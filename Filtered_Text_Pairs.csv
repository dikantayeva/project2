"A multi-armed bandit with finitely many arms is studied when each arm is a homogeneous Markov process on an underlying finite state space. The transition law of one of the arms, referred to as the odd arm, is different from the common transition law of all other arms. A learner, who has no knowledge of the above transition laws, has to devise a sequential test to identify the index of the odd arm as quickly as possible, subject to an upper bound on the probability of error. For this problem, we derive an asymptotic lower bound on the expected stopping time of any sequential test of the learner, where the asymptotics is as the probability of error vanishes. Furthermore, we propose a sequential test, and show that the asymptotic behaviour of its expected stopping time comes arbitrarily close to that of the lower bound. Prior works deal with independent and identically distributed arms, whereas our work deals with Markov arms. Our analysis of the rested Markov setting is a key first step in understanding the difficult case of restless Markov setting, which is still open.","We examined a multi-armed bandit with a limited number of arms, where each arm operates as a homogeneous Markov process on a finite state space. One of the arms, known as the odd arm, has a transition law that is different from the common transition law of the other arms. A learner, lacking knowledge of these transition laws, must create a sequential test to quickly identify the odd arm without exceeding a certain probability of error. We have established a minimum expected stopping time for any sequential test as the probability of error approaches zero. Additionally, we have proposed a sequential test whose expected stopping time closely approaches this minimum. While previous research has focused on independent and identically distributed arms, our work specifically addresses Markov arms. This analysis of the Markov setting is an essential initial step in understanding the more complex case of restless Markov settings, which remains unexplored.",yes

"Motivated by the Internet-of-things and sensor networks for cyberphysical systems, the problem of dynamic sensor activation for the centralized tracking of an i.i.d. time-varying process is examined. The tradeoff is between energy efficiency, which decreases with the number of active sensors, and fidelity, which increases with the number of active sensors. The problem of minimizing the time-averaged mean-squared error over infinite horizon is examined under the constraint of the mean number of active sensors. The proposed methods artfully combine Gibbs sampling and stochastic approximation for learning, in order to create a high performance, energy efficient tracking mechanisms with active sensor selection. Centralized tracking of i.i.d. process with known distribution as well as an unknown parametric distribution are considered. For an i.i.d. process with known distribution, convergence to the global optimal solution with high probability is proved. The main challenge of the i.i.d. case is that the process has a distribution parameterized by a known or unknown parameter which must be learned; one key theoretical result proves that the proposed algorithm for tracking an i.i.d. process with unknown parametric distribution converges to local optima. Numerical results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and also suggest that global optimality is in fact achieved in some cases.","The text examines the problem of dynamic sensor activation for tracking a time-varying process, balancing energy efficiency and fidelity.

"Multi-target multi-camera tracking (MTMCT) systems track targets across cameras. Due to the continuity of target trajectories, tracking systems usually restrict their data association within a local neighborhood. In single camera tracking, local neighborhood refers to consecutive frames; in multi-camera tracking, it refers to neighboring cameras that the target may appear successively. For similarity estimation, tracking systems often adopt appearance features learned from the re-identification (re-ID) perspective. Different from tracking, re-ID usually does not have access to the trajectory cues that can limit the search space to a local neighborhood. Due to its global matching property, the re-ID perspective requires to learn global appearance features. We argue that the mismatch between the local matching procedure in tracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may compromise MTMCT performance. To fit the local matching procedure in MTMCT, in this work, we introduce locality aware appearance metric (LAAM). Specifically, we design an intra-camera metric for single camera tracking, and an inter-camera metric for multi-camera tracking. Both metrics are trained with data pairs sampled from their corresponding local neighborhoods, as opposed to global sampling in the re-ID perspective. We show that the locally learned metrics can be successfully applied on top of several globally learned re-ID features. With the proposed method, we report new state-of-the-art performance on the DukeMTMC dataset, and a substantial improvement on the CityFlow dataset.","Systems that track multiple targets across multiple cameras (MTMCT) monitor targets across different cameras. Tracking systems typically restrict their data association to a local area because of the continuity of target trajectories. The term ""local neighborhood"" refers to consecutive frames in single-camera tracking and neighboring cameras that the target may appear in successively in multi-camera tracking. Tracking systems frequently use appearance features learned from the re-identification (re-ID) viewpoint to estimate similarity. Unlike tracking, re-ID does not usually have access to the trajectory cues that can restrict the search space to a local area. Because of its global matching characteristics, the re-ID viewpoint requires learning global appearance features. We contend that the disparity between the local matching process in tracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may impair MTMCT performance. In this study, we propose the locality-aware appearance metric (LAAM) to address this issue.

" Consistency is defined with respect to strong simulation conformance. We propose learning algorithms that use traditional and a new stochastic state-space partitioning, the latter resulting in the minimum number of states. We then use them to solve the problem of active learning, that uses a knowledgeable teacher to generate samples as counterexamples to simulation equivalence queries. We show that the problem is undecidable in general, but that it becomes decidable under a suitable condition on the teacher which comes naturally from the way samples are generated from failed simulation checks. The latter problem is shown to be undecidable if we impose an additional condition on the learner to always conjecture a minimum state hypothesis. We therefore propose a semi-algorithm using stochastic partitions. Finally, we apply the proposed (semi algorithms to infer intermediate assumptions in an automated assume-guarantee verification framework for probabilistic systems.","In this study, we address the challenge of inducing a non-deterministic probabilistic tree automaton (NPTA) that accurately represents the stochastic regularities embedded within a finite corpus of tree-structured data. The proposed method seeks to generalize beyond the observed samples to potentially infinite sets of unseen instances by capturing the underlying probabilities governing the generation of the trees. We introduce a novel algorithmic framework that iteratively refines the NPTA by leveraging both positive examples, which are trees accepted by the system, and negative examples, which are trees that should be rejected. Our approach utilizes a combination of statistical inference techniques and heuristic-guided search to optimize the state transitions and probability distributions of the automaton. To evaluate our method's performance, we conduct experiments on synthetic datasets designed to simulate various complexities and stochastic behaviors of tree-generating processes. We also apply our framework to real-world datasets from natural language processing and bioinformatics to demonstrate its applicability to practical problems involving hierarchical data structures.

" A popular model for such problems is to embed sentences into fixed size vectors, and use composition functions (e.g. concatenation or sum) of those vectors as features for the prediction. At the same time, composition of embeddings has been a main focus within the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) whose goal is to predict relations between entities (typically from knowledge base triples). In this article, we show that previous work on relation prediction between texts implicitly uses compositions from baseline SRL models. We show that such compositions are not expressive enough for several tasks (e.g. natural language inference). We build on recent SRL models to address textual relational problems, showing that they are more expressive, and can alleviate issues from simpler compositions. The resulting models significantly improve the state of the art in both transferable sentence representation learning and relation prediction.","Embedding sentences is a common approach for modeling semantic relations between textual elements in NLP problems. By representing sentences as dense vectors in a continuous vector space, it allows for capturing the semantic meaning and relationships between them. This technique has been widely used for tasks such as predicting sentence similarity, entailment, and discourse relations. Various methods for sentence embedding have been proposed, including neural network-based models and pre-trained word embeddings. These approaches have shown promising results in capturing the nuanced semantic relations between textual elements, making them valuable tools for a wide range of NLP applications.",no

" Reservoir computing is a growing paradigm for simplified training of recurrent neural networks, with a high potential for hardware implementations. Numerous experiments in optics and electronics yield comparable performance to digital state-of-the-art algorithms. Many of the most recent works in the field focus on large-scale photonic systems, with tens of thousands of physical nodes and arbitrary interconnections. While this trend significantly expands the potential applications of photonic reservoir computing, it also complicates the optimisation of the high number of hyper hyp parameters of the system. Methods. In this work, we propose the use of Bayesian optimisation for efficient exploration of the hyper hyp parameter space in a minimum number of iteration. Results. We test this approach on a previously reported large-scale experimental system, compare it to the commonly used grid search, and report notable improvements in performance and the number of experimental iterations required to optimise the hyper hyp parameters. Conclusion. Bayesian optimisation thus has the potential to become the standard method for tuning the hyper hyp parameters in photonic reservoir computing.","In recent years, there has been a growing interest in large scale photonic systems due to their potential applications in telecommunications, data processing, and sensing.

The ability to scale these systems to hundreds or even thousands of elements presents both opportunities and challenges in terms of design, control, and integration. In this paper, we review recent advances in the development of large scale photonic systems and discuss the key technical and practical considerations in their implementation.

"Air-gapped systems are systems that aren't connected to any network. These systems generally run critical operations or have sensitive data, so limiting exposure to outside networks is a necessary security measure. Mordechai Guri and his team have been researching methods of extracting data from air-gapped systems and have developed a plethora of techniques over the years. A new technique involves installing malware onto the air-gapped machine which makes the fans inside the computer vibrate at certain frequencies. These frequencies can be recorded using a phone's accelerometer and then decoded later on. While the technique is innovative, it is extremely slow, extracting data at half a bit per second. Real-life attackers are likely to use faster methods."," Some countries' militaries use them for their most sensitive operations, but cybersecurity researchers have found ways to hack them.

" Inspired by the topical correspondence between mathematical equations and word contexts observed in scientific texts, we propose a novel topic model that jointly generates mathematical equations and their surrounding text (TopicEq). Using an extension of the correlated topic model, the context is generated from a mixture of latent topics, and the equation is generated by an RNN that depends on the latent topic activations. To experiment with this model, we create a corpus of 400K equation-context pairs extracted from a range of scientific articles from arXiv, and fit the model using a variational autoencoder approach. Experimental results show that this joint model significantly outperforms existing topic models and equation models for scientific texts. Moreover, we qualitatively show that the model effectively captures the relationship between topics and mathematics, enabling novel applications such as topic-aware equation generation, equation topic inference, and topic-aware alignment of mathematical symbols and words.","In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on the use of mathematical models to describe complex phenomena in the natural and social sciences. These models often involve the use of equations, algorithms, and statistical methods to represent and analyze data. Furthermore, the integration of text with mathematics has allowed for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of scientific concepts, facilitating the dissemination of knowledge and the development of new ideas. This paper explores the interconnectedness of mathematics and text in scientific communication and discusses the potential implications for the future of scientific research and publication. By examining the relationship between mathematics and text, we can gain a deeper understanding of how scientific knowledge is constructed and conveyed, ultimately leading to advancements in various fields of study.",no
" A popular model for such problems is to embed sentences into fixed size vectors, and use composition functions (e.g. concatenation or sum) of those vectors as features for the prediction. At the same time, composition of embeddings has been a main focus within the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) whose goal is to predict relations between entities (typically from knowledge base triples). In this article, we show that previous work on relation prediction between texts implicitly uses compositions from baseline SRL models. We show that such compositions are not expressive enough for several tasks (e.g. natural language inference). We build on recent SRL models to address textual relational problems, showing that they are more expressive, and can alleviate issues from simpler compositions. The resulting models significantly improve the state of the art in both transferable sentence representation learning and relation prediction.","
In order to solve these NLP problems, we aim to learn a robust representation of text that captures the underlying semantic relations. Previous work has focused on embedding sentences in a high-dimensional vector space, where similarity between vectors corresponds to similarity in meaning. However, these vector-based models are limited in their ability to capture complex relationships between sentences, such as entailment and contradiction. We propose a novel approach that leverages the power of natural language inference (NLI) to model semantic relations between sentences. NLI is the task of determining the relationship between two sentences, such as entailment, contradiction, or neutral. By training a neural network to perform NLI, we can learn a rich representation of text that captures the nuances of semantic relationships. Our approach consists of two main components: a sentence encoder and an NLI classifier. The sentence encoder maps each sentence to a dense vector in a high-dimensional space,",no

"We present a novel approach of creating face makeup upon a face image with another images as the style examples. Our approach is analogous to physical makeup, as we modify the color and skin details while preserving the face structure. More precisely, we extract image foregrounds from both subject and multiple example images. Then by using image matting algorithms, the system extracts the semantic information such as faces, lips, teeth, eyes, eyebrows, etc., from the extracted foregrounds of both subject and multiple example images. And, then the makeup style is transferred between the corresponding parts with the same semantic information. Next we get the face makeup transferred result by seamlessly compositing different parts together using alpha blending. In the final step, we present an efficient method of makeup consistency to optimize the color of a collection of images showing the common scene. The main advantage of our method over existing techniques is that it does not need face matching, as one could use more than one example images. Because one example image does not fulfill the complete requirements of a user. Our algorithm is not restricted to head shot images as we can also change the makeup style in the wild. Moreover, our algorithm does not require to choose the same pose and image size between subject and example images.

" Reservoir computing is a growing paradigm for simplified training of recurrent neural networks, with a high potential for hardware implementations. Numerous experiments in optics and electronics yield comparable performance to digital state-of-the-art algorithms. Many of the most recent works in the field focus on large-scale photonic systems, with tens of thousands of physical nodes and arbitrary interconnections. While this trend significantly expands the potential applications of photonic reservoir computing, it also complicates the optimisation of the high number of hyper hyp parameters of the system. Methods. In this work, we propose the use of Bayesian optimisation for efficient exploration of the hyper hyp parameter space in a minimum number of iteration. Results. We test this approach on a previously reported large-scale experimental system, compare it to the commonly used grid search, and report notable improvements in performance and the number of experimental iterations required to optimise the hyper hyp parameters. Conclusion. Bayesian optimisation thus has the potential to become the standard method for tuning the hyper hyp parameters in photonic reservoir computing.","The advent of large-scale photonic systems has revolutionized numerous fields ranging from telecommunications to quantum computing.

" Supervised machine learning enables the detection and exploitation of findings that are known a priori after annotation of training examples by experts. However, supervision does not scale well, due to the amount of necessary training examples, and the limitation of the marker vocabulary to known entities. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose unsupervised identification of anomalies as candidates for markers in retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging data without a constraint to a priori definitions. We identify and categorize marker candidates occurring frequently in the data, and demonstrate that these markers show predictive value in the task of detecting disease. A careful qualitative analysis of the identified data driven markers reveals how their quantifiable occurrence aligns with our current understanding of disease course, in early- and late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients. A multi-scale deep denoising autoencoder is trained on healthy images, and a one-class support vector machine identifies anomalies in new data. Clustering in the anomalies identifies stable categories. Using these markers to classify healthy-, early AMD- and late AMD cases yields an accuracy of 81.40. In a second binary classification experiment on a publicly available data set (healthy vs. intermediate AMD) the model achieves an AUC of 0.944.","Macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in adults over the age of 50.

" By a theorem of McNaughton and Papert, these are also the first-order definable languages. The dot-depth rose to prominence following the work of Thomas, who proved an exact correspondence with the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic: each level in the dot-depth hierarchy consists of all languages that can be defined with a prescribed number of quantifier blocks. One of the most famous open problems in automata theory is to settle whether the membership problem is decidable for each level: is it possible to decide whether an input regular language belongs to this level? Despite a significant research effort, membership by itself has only been solved for low levels. A recent breakthrough was achieved by replacing membership with a more general problem: separation . Given two input languages, one has to decide whether there exists a third language in the investigated level containing the first language and disjoint from the second. The motivation for looking at separation is threefold: (1) while more difficult, it is more rewarding, as solving it requires a better understanding; (2) being more general, it provides a more convenient framework, and (3) all recent membership algorithms are actually reductions to separation for lower levels. We present a separation algorithm for dot-depth two. A key point is that while dot-depth two is our most prominent application, our theorem is more general. We consider a family of hierarchies, which includes the dot-depth: concatenation hierarchies. They are built through a generic construction process: one first chooses an initial class, the basis, which serves as the lowest level in the hierarchy. Then, further levels are built by applying generic operations. Our main theorem states that for any concatenation hierarchy whose basis consists of finitely many languages, separation is decidable for level one. In the special case of the dot-depth, this can be lifted to level two using previously known results.","The dot-depth hierarchy, proposed by Brzozowski and Cohen, aims to categorize the star-free languages of finite words based on their structural properties. This hierarchy provides a systematic framework for understanding the complexity and expressive power of star-free languages, which are devoid of the Kleene star operation. By organizing these languages into a hierarchical structure, the dot-depth hierarchy allows for a comprehensive analysis of their properties and relationships, ultimately facilitating the development of efficient algorithms and decision procedures for working with star-free languages. Furthermore, the dot-depth hierarchy serves as a valuable tool for theoretical computer scientists and automata theorists in their quest to explore the boundaries of regular languages and their subclasses.",no

" We consider a slotted-mode of operation where each slot of SU is used for either energy harvesting or data transmission. Considering block fading with memory, we model the energy arrival and fading processes as a stationary Markov process of first order. We propose a harvest-or-transmit policy for the SU along with optimal transmit powers that maximize its expected throughput under three different settings. First, we consider a learning-theoretic approach where we do not assume any apriori knowledge about the underlying Markov processes. In this case, we obtain an online policy using Q-learning . Then, we assume that the full statistical knowledge of the governing Markov process is known apriori. Under this assumption, we obtain an optimal online policy using infinite horizon stochastic dynamic programming . Finally, we obtain an optimal offline policy using the generalized Benders decomposition algorithm. The offline policy assumes that for a given time deadline, the energy arrivals and channel states are known in advance at all the transmitters. Finally, we compare all policies and study the effects of various system parameters on the system performance.","In this context, we propose a novel energy harvesting protocol for the SU that maximizes the utilization of ambient energy sources while ensuring minimal interference with the primary user (PU) network operations. Our protocol employs a dynamic spectrum access strategy, which allows the SU to adapt its transmission power and frequency based on the PU's activity and the availability of harvested energy. To evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol, we develop a mathematical model that captures the stochastic nature of both the energy harvesting process and the PU's activity. We then derive the optimal policy for the SU that maximizes its throughput while satisfying interference constraints with respect to the PU. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol significantly improves the energy efficiency and throughput of the SU compared to conventional fixed-spectrum access schemes. Moreover, the results indicate that our protocol maintains the required quality of service for the PU, thereby validating its potential for practical deployment in underlay cognitive radio networks. Our findings suggest that energy-efficient, adaptive spectrum management is a viable solution for the future",no

"Supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms are aimed at maximizing classification performance under available energy and storage constraints. They try to map the training data to the corresponding labels while ensuring generalizability to unseen data. However, they do not integrate meaning-based relationships among labels in the decision process. On the other hand, natural language processing (NLP) algorithms emphasize the importance of semantic information. In this paper, we synthesize the complementary advantages of supervised ML and natural language processing algorithms into one method that we refer to as SECRET (Semantically Enhanced Classification of REal-world Tasks). SECRET performs classifications by fusing the semantic information of the labels with the available data: it combines the feature space of the supervised algorithms with the semantic space of the NLP algorithms and predicts labels based on this joint space. Experimental results indicate that, compared to traditional supervised learning, SECRET achieves up to 13.9 accuracy and 13.5 F1 score improvements.

"Despite many recent advances for the design of dialogue systems, a true bottleneck remains the acquisition of data required to train its components. Unlike many other language processing applications, dialogue systems require interactions with users, therefore it is complex to develop them with pre-recorded data. Building on previous works, on-line learning is pursued here as a most convenient way to address the issue. Data collection, annotation and use in learning algorithms are performed in a single process. The main difficulties are then: to bootstrap an initial basic system, and to control the level of additional cost on the user side. Considering that well-performing solutions can be used directly off the shelf for speech recognition and synthesis, the study is focused on learning the spoken language understanding and dialogue management modules only. Several variants of joint learning are investigated and tested with user trials to confirm that the overall on-line learning can be obtained after only a few hundred training dialogues and can overstep an expert-based system.","The development of dialogue systems is hindered by the lack of data for training, which cannot be easily obtained through pre-recorded data due to the need for user interactions.

" In this paper, we model such a two-layer heterogenous network based on stochastic geometry approach. We aim at minimizing the expected power consumption of the D2D layer while satisfying the outage performance of both D2D layer and cellular layer. We consider two kinds of power control schemes. The first one is referred as to independent power control where the transmit powers are statistically independent of the networks and all channel conditions. The second is named as dependent power control where the transmit power of each user is dependent on its own channel condition. A closed-form expression of optimal independent power control is derived, and we point out that the optimal power control for this case is fixed and not relevant to the randomness of the network. For the dependent power control case, we propose an efficient way to find the close-to-optimal solution for the power-efficiency optimization problem. Numerical results show that dependent power control scheme saves about half of power that the independent power control scheme demands.","

"Process mining techniques focus on extracting insight in processes from event logs.

"Consider the following problem. A seller has infinite copies of n products represented by nodes in a graph. There are m consumers, each has a budget and wants to buy two products. Consumers are represented by weighted edges. Given the prices of products, each consumer will buy both products she wants, at the given price, if she can afford to. Our objective is to help the seller price the products to maximize her profit. This problem is called graph vertex pricing (GVP) problem and has resisted several recent attempts despite its current simple solution. This motivates the study of this problem on special classes of graphs. In this paper, we study this problem on a large class of graphs such as graphs with bounded treewidth, bounded genus and k -partite graphs. We show that there exists an FPTAS for GVP on graphs with bounded treewidth. This result is also extended to an FPTAS for the more general single-minded pricing problem. On bounded genus graphs we present a PTAS and show that GVP is NP -hard even on planar graphs. We study the Sherali-Adams hierarchy applied to a natural Integer Program formulation that ( 1 ) -approximates the optimal solution of GVP . Sherali-Adams hierarchy has gained much interest recently as a possible approach to develop new approximation algorithms.

" In safety-critical systems, it is paramount that the learner's actions do not violate the safety constraints at any stage of the learning process. In this paper, we study a stochastic bandit optimization problem where the unknown payoff and constraint functions are sampled from Gaussian Processes (GPs) first considered in . We develop a safe variant of GP-UCB called SGP-UCB, with necessary modifications to respect safety constraints at every round. The algorithm has two distinct phases. The first phase seeks to estimate the set of safe actions in the decision set, while the second phase follows the GP-UCB decision rule. Our main contribution is to derive the first sub-linear regret bounds for this problem. We numerically compare SGP-UCB against existing safe Bayesian GP optimization algorithms.","In this work, we propose a novel framework for sequential decision-making in the presence of uncertainties surrounding both the payoff function and the safety constraints of a given system. Our approach employs a Bayesian optimization strategy, enabling the learner to update its beliefs about the unknown payoff function while simultaneously considering probabilistic representations of safety constraints. We integrate a Gaussian Process (GP) model to predict the payoff function, which facilitates a sequential updating mechanism to refine the model based on observed data. Furthermore, we incorporate a chance-constraint formulation to address the safety requirements, ensuring that the proposed actions by the learner adhere to the specified safety thresholds with high probability. We conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in various synthetic and real-world scenarios.

" Indeed, the vast literature on computational epidemiology offers solid grounds for analytical studies and the definition of novel models aimed at both predictive and prescriptive scenario descriptions.

"We study the online learning problem of a bidder who participates in repeated auctions. With the goal of maximizing his T-period payoff, the bidder determines the optimal allocation of his budget among his bids for K goods at each period. As a bidding strategy, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm, inspired by the dynamic programming approach to the knapsack problem. The proposed algorithm, referred to as dynamic programming on discrete set (DPDS), achieves a regret order of O ( T log T). By showing that the regret is lower bounded by (T) for any strategy, we conclude that DPDS is order optimal up to a log T term. We evaluate the performance of DPDS empirically in the context of virtual trading in wholesale electricity markets by using historical data from the New York market. Empirical results show that DPDS consistently outperforms benchmark heuristic methods that are derived from machine learning and online learning approaches.","In this study, we investigate the performance of various online learning algorithms in the context of repeated auctions.

"Finding communities or clusters in social networks is a famous topic in social network analysis. Most algorithms are limited to static snapshots, so they cannot handle dynamics within the underlying graph. In this paper we present a modification of the Louvain community detection method to handle changes in the graph without rerunning the full algorithm. Also, we adapted the Louvain greedy approach to optimize the Infomap measure. The main idea is, to recalculate only a small area around the changes. Depending on the graph size and the amount of changes, this yields a massive runtime decrease. As validation data, we provide a graph generator, which produces specific community structures, at given times and also intermediate steps to transform the graph from one to another specific graph. Experiments show that runtime decrease is possible without much loss of quality. These values depend on the reprocessed area inside the graph.","The paper introduces a modification to the Louvain community detection method that can handle changes in the graph without rerunning the full algorithm, resulting in a decrease in runtime without much loss of quality.

" Supervised machine learning enables the detection and exploitation of findings that are known a priori after annotation of training examples by experts. However, supervision does not scale well, due to the amount of necessary training examples, and the limitation of the marker vocabulary to known entities. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose unsupervised identification of anomalies as candidates for markers in retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging data without a constraint to a priori definitions. We identify and categorize marker candidates occurring frequently in the data, and demonstrate that these markers show predictive value in the task of detecting disease. A careful qualitative analysis of the identified data driven markers reveals how their quantifiable occurrence aligns with our current understanding of disease course, in early- and late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients. A multi-scale deep denoising autoencoder is trained on healthy images, and a one-class support vector machine identifies anomalies in new data. Clustering in the anomalies identifies stable categories. Using these markers to classify healthy-, early AMD- and late AMD cases yields an accuracy of 81.40. In a second binary classification experiment on a publicly available data set (healthy vs. intermediate AMD) the model achieves an AUC of 0.944.","In this study, we focus on the application of advanced imaging techniques for the detection and evaluation of macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss.

The system's efficacy is validated through a series of tests involving multispectral retinal scans from a diverse cohort of patients. Our results suggest that integrating this computational approach with conventional clinical assessments can significantly improve the accuracy of AMD-related predictions and guide tailored treatment strategies. The implications of these findings pave the way for more effective disease management and a better understanding of AMD progression, potentially contributing to the development of therapeutic interventions.",no

" In this paper, we conduct a qualitative study to explore why email spoofing is still possible after years of efforts to design, develop, and promote anti-spoofing protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). Previous research shows that the adoption rates of anti-spoofing protocols are still very low. To understand the reasons behind the slow adoption, we conduct a user study with 9 email administrators from different institutions. The results show that email administrators are aware of the weaknesses of these protocols and believe the current protocol adoption lacks the crucial mass due to the protocol defects, weak incentives, and practical deployment challenges. Based on these results, we discuss the key implications to protocol designers, email providers and users, and future research directions to mitigate the email spoofing threats.","In light of this, the development and implementation of robust anti-spoofing protocols are essential for the mitigation of such security threats.

"Despite many recent advances for the design of dialogue systems, a true bottleneck remains the acquisition of data required to train its components. Unlike many other language processing applications, dialogue systems require interactions with users, therefore it is complex to develop them with pre-recorded data. Building on previous works, on-line learning is pursued here as a most convenient way to address the issue. Data collection, annotation and use in learning algorithms are performed in a single process. The main difficulties are then: to bootstrap an initial basic system, and to control the level of additional cost on the user side. Considering that well-performing solutions can be used directly off the shelf for speech recognition and synthesis, the study is focused on learning the spoken language understanding and dialogue management modules only. Several variants of joint learning are investigated and tested with user trials to confirm that the overall on-line learning can be obtained after only a few hundred training dialogues and can overstep an expert-based system.","The acquisition of data remains a challenge for dialogue system design, with on-line learning being pursued as a solution.

"This paper addresses the problem of stably recovering sparse or compressible signals from compressed sensing measurements that have undergone optimal non-uniform scalar quantization, i.e. , minimizing the common 2 -norm distortion. Generally, this Quantized Compressed Sensing (QCS) problem is solved by minimizing the 1 -norm constrained by the 2 -norm distortion. In such cases, re-measurement and quantization of the reconstructed signal do not necessarily match the initial observations, showing that the whole QCS model is not consistent . Our approach considers instead that quantization distortion more closely resembles heteroscedastic uniform noise, with variance depending on the observed quantization bin. Generalizing our previous work on uniform quantization, we show that for non-uniform quantizers described by the ""compander"" formalism, quantization distortion may be better characterized as having bounded weighted p -norm ( p 2), for a particular weighting. We develop a new reconstruction approach, termed Generalized Basis Pursuit DeNoise (GBPDN), which minimizes the 1 -norm of the signal to reconstruct constrained by this weighted p -norm fidelity. We prove that, for standard Gaussian sensing matrices and K sparse or compressible signals in R N with at least K log N K) p 2) measurements, i.e. , under strongly oversampled QCS scenario, GBPDN is - 2 1 instance optimal and stable recovers all such sparse or compressible signals. The reconstruction error decreases as O ( 2 - B p 1) given a budget of B bits per measurement. This yields a reduction by a factor p 1 of the reconstruction error compared to the one produced by 2 -norm constrained decoders. We also propose an primal-dual proximal splitting scheme to solve the GBPDN program which is efficient for large-scale problems. Interestingly, extensive simulations testing the GBPDN effectiveness confirm the trend predicted by the theory, that the reconstruction error can indeed be reduced by increasing p , but this is achieved at a much less stringent oversampling regime than the one expected by the theoretical bounds. Besides the QCS scenario, we also show that GBPDN applies straightforwardly to the related case of CS measurements corrupted by heteroscedastic Generalized Gaussian noise with provable reconstruction error reduction.","The paper presents a new method called Generalized Basis Pursuit DeNoise (GBPDN) to recover sparse signals from Quantized Compressed Sensing (QCS) measurements by minimizing the 1-norm of the signal constrained by a weighted p-norm that accounts for quantization distortion.

"The Count-Min sketch is an important and well-studied data summarization method. It allows one to estimate the count of any item in a stream using a small, fixed size data sketch. However, the accuracy of the sketch depends on characteristics of the underlying data. This has led to a number of count estimation procedures which work well in one scenario but perform poorly in others. A practitioner is faced with two basic, unanswered questions. Which variant should be chosen when the data is unknown? Given an estimate, is its error sufficiently small to be trustworthy? We provide answers to these questions. We derive new count estimators, including a provably optimal estimator, which best or match previous estimators in all scenarios. We also provide practical, tight error bounds at query time for both new and existing estimators. These error estimates also yield procedures to choose the sketch tuning parameters optimally, as they can extrapolate the error to different choices of sketch width and depth. The key observation is that the distribution of errors in each counter can be empirically estimated from the sketch itself. By first estimating this distribution, count estimation becomes a statistical estimation and inference problem with a known error distribution. This provides both a principled way to derive new and optimal estimators as well as a way to study the error and properties of existing estimators.","The Count-Min sketch is an important and well-studied data summarization method.

"In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation of the efficacy of knowledge distillation and its dependence on student and teacher architectures. Starting with the observation that more accurate teachers often don't make good teachers, we attempt to tease apart the factors that affect knowledge distillation performance. We find crucially that larger models do not often make better teachers. We show that this is a consequence of mismatched capacity, and that small students are unable to mimic large teachers. We find typical ways of circumventing this (such as performing a sequence of knowledge distillation steps) to be ineffective. Finally, we show that this effect can be mitigated by stopping the teacher's training early. Our results generalize across datasets and models.","text: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation and its relationship to student and teacher architectures. We begin by noting that more accurate teachers do not always make effective teachers, and we try to identify the factors that affect knowledge distillation performance.

" The power graph fused lasso (PGFL) segments a matrix by exploiting a known graphical structure, G , over the rows and columns. Our main results shows that for any connected graph, under subGaussian noise, the PGFL achieves the same mean-square error rate as 2D total variation denoising for signals of bounded variation. We study the use of the PGFL for denoising an observed network H , where we learn the graph G as the K -nearest neighborhood graph of an estimated metric over the vertices. We provide theoretical and empirical results for estimating graphons, a non-parametric exchangeable network model, and compare to the state of the art graphon estimation methods.","In this paper, we present a novel framework for extending the total variation denoising method to Cartesian power graphs, which allows for the estimation of non-parametric network models.

"The Count-Min sketch is an important and well-studied data summarization method. It allows one to estimate the count of any item in a stream using a small, fixed size data sketch. However, the accuracy of the sketch depends on characteristics of the underlying data. This has led to a number of count estimation procedures which work well in one scenario but perform poorly in others. A practitioner is faced with two basic, unanswered questions. Which variant should be chosen when the data is unknown? Given an estimate, is its error sufficiently small to be trustworthy? We provide answers to these questions. We derive new count estimators, including a provably optimal estimator, which best or match previous estimators in all scenarios. We also provide practical, tight error bounds at query time for both new and existing estimators. These error estimates also yield procedures to choose the sketch tuning parameters optimally, as they can extrapolate the error to different choices of sketch width and depth. The key observation is that the distribution of errors in each counter can be empirically estimated from the sketch itself. By first estimating this distribution, count estimation becomes a statistical estimation and inference problem with a known error distribution. This provides both a principled way to derive new and optimal estimators as well as a way to study the error and properties of existing estimators.","The Count-Min sketch is a widely regarded technique for summarizing data, enabling estimation of element counts within a stream via a compact fixed-size summary. Yet, the effectiveness of the sketch hinges on the data's specifics, which has given rise to various counting methods effective in certain cases but inadequate in others. This poses two fundamental, yet unresolved issues for professionals: how to select the appropriate variant for unfamiliar data, and how to gauge the reliability of an estimate by its error margin. Our work offers solutions to these problems. We introduce novel counting estimators, including one that is theoretically optimal, outperforming or equaling past estimators across various situations. Additionally, we establish precise, actionable error margins useful at the query stage for both new and existing estimators. From these error evaluations, we can infer the best parameters for tuning sketches since the errors associated with various sketch sizes and levels can be predicted. This is based on a critical insight: the error distribution for each counter can be empirically determined directly from the sketch. Beginning with an assessment of this distribution transforms count estimation into a statistical problem of estimation and inference, complete with a quantifiable error distribution. This not only lays the foundation for creating new and optimal estimators but also offers a systematic approach to assess the errors and characteristics of current estimators.",yes

" Existing techniques for detecting spam include predicting the trustworthiness of accounts and analyzing the content of these messages. However, advanced attackers can still successfully evade these defenses. Online social networks bring people who have personal connections or share common interests to form communities. In this paper, we first show that users within a networked community share some topics of interest. Moreover, content shared on these social network tend to propagate according to the interests of people. Dissemination paths may emerge where some communities post similar messages, based on the interests of those communities. Spam and other malicious content, on the other hand, follow different spreading patterns. In this paper, we follow this insight and present POISED , a system that leverages the differences in propagation between benign and malicious messages on social networks to identify spam and other unwanted content. We test our system on a dataset of 1.3M tweets collected from 64K users, and we show that our approach is effective in detecting malicious messages, reaching 91 precision and 93 recall. We also show that POISED 's detection is more comprehensive than previous systems, by comparing it to three state-of-the-art spam detection systems that have been proposed by the research community in the past. POISED significantly outperforms each of these systems. Moreover, through simulations, we show how POISED is effective in the early detection of spam messages and how it is resilient against two well-known adversarial machine learning attacks.","In this study, we explore the dynamics of communities spam within online social networks to understand the mechanisms cybercriminals leverage to disseminate unwanted content.

" We show that, for a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network to approximate a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function approximation.

We show that shallow networks (i.e., networks whose depth does not depend on ) require ( poly ( 1 neurons while deep networks (i.e., networks whose depth grows with 1 ) require O ( polylog ( 1 neurons. We then extend these results to certain classes of important multivariate functions.

" We introduce a novel quantity called forward regret that intuitively measures how good an online learning algorithm is if it is allowed a one-step look-ahead into the future. We show that given stability, bounded forward regret is equivalent to bounded regret. We also show that the existence of an algorithm with bounded regret implies the existence of a stable algorithm with bounded regret and bounded forward regret. The equivalence results apply to general, possibly non-convex problems. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the first general connection between stability and regret in the online setting that is not restricted to a particular class of algorithms. Our stability-regret connection provides a simple recipe for analyzing regret incurred by any online learning algorithm. Using our framework, we analyze several existing online learning algorithms as well as the ""approximate"" versions of algorithms like RDA that solve an optimization problem at each iteration. Our proofs are simpler than existing analysis for the respective algorithms, show a clear trade-off between stability and forward regret, and provide tighter regret bounds in some cases. Furthermore, using our recipe, we analyze ""approximate"" versions of several algorithms such as follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) that requires solving an optimization problem at each step."," This research focuses on the robustness of online learning methods and the relationship between bounded regret and learnability.

" However, recent studies demonstrate that, when equipped with expressive generative distributions (aka. decoders), VAE suffers from learning uninformative latent representations with the observation called KL Varnishing , in which case VAE collapses into an unconditional generative model. In this work, we introduce mutual posterior-divergence regularization , a novel regularization that is able to control the geometry of the latent space to accomplish meaningful representation learning, while achieving comparable or superior capability of density estimation. Experiments on three image benchmark datasets demonstrate that, when equipped with powerful decoders, our model performs well both on density estimation and representation learning."," In this work, we focus on developing a new variant of VAE that incorporates divergence regularization to enhance its ability to model expressive generative distributions. Specifically, we introduce a novel regularization term that encourages the learned latent space to have a uniform distribution of latent codes, leading to improved sample quality and modeled complexity. Our proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets and shows superior performance in generating diverse and coherent samples compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of divergence regularization on the VAE's ability to model complex distributions, demonstrating its role in improving the model's capacity for explicit generative modeling.",no

"The concept of device-to-Device (D2D) communication as an underlay coexistence with cellular networks gains many advantages of improving system performance. In this paper, we model such a two-layer heterogenous network based on stochastic geometry approach. We aim at minimizing the expected power consumption of the D2D layer while satisfying the outage performance of both D2D layer and cellular layer. We consider two kinds of power control schemes. The first one is referred as to independent power control where the transmit powers are statistically independent of the networks and all channel conditions. The second is named as dependent power control where the transmit power of each user is dependent on its own channel condition. A closed-form expression of optimal independent power control is derived, and we point out that the optimal power control for this case is fixed and not relevant to the randomness of the network. For the dependent power control case, we propose an efficient way to find the close-to-optimal solution for the power-efficiency optimization problem. Numerical results show that dependent power control scheme saves about half of power that the independent power control scheme demands.","text: The paper discusses the benefits of using device-to-device (D2D) communication in conjunction with cellular networks, and presents a two-layer heterogeneous network model based on stochastic geometry.

" Supervised machine learning enables the detection and exploitation of findings that are known a priori after annotation of training examples by experts. However, supervision does not scale well, due to the amount of necessary training examples, and the limitation of the marker vocabulary to known entities. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose unsupervised identification of anomalies as candidates for markers in retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging data without a constraint to a priori definitions. We identify and categorize marker candidates occurring frequently in the data, and demonstrate that these markers show predictive value in the task of detecting disease. A careful qualitative analysis of the identified data driven markers reveals how their quantifiable occurrence aligns with our current understanding of disease course, in early- and late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients. A multi-scale deep denoising autoencoder is trained on healthy images, and a one-class support vector machine identifies anomalies in new data. Clustering in the anomalies identifies stable categories. Using these markers to classify healthy-, early AMD- and late AMD cases yields an accuracy of 81.40. In a second binary classification experiment on a publicly available data set (healthy vs. intermediate AMD) the model achieves an AUC of 0.944.","

We evaluate the performance of our approach using a set of 100 images with varied stages of AMD and compare the results to those obtained using traditional computer-aided diagnosis methods.

"Massive MIMO is seen as a main enabler for low-latency communications, thanks to its high spatial degrees of freedom. The channel hardening and favorable propagation properties of Massive MIMO are particularly important for multiplexing several URLLC devices. However, the actual utility of channel hardening and spatial multiplexing is dependent critically on the accuracy of channel knowledge. When several low-latency devices are multiplexed, the cost for acquiring accurate knowledge becomes critical, and it is not evident how many devices can be served with a latency-reliability requirement and how many pilot symbols should be allocated. This paper investigates the trade-off between achieving high spectral efficiency and high reliability in the downlink, by employing various power allocation strategies, for maximum ratio and minimum mean square error precoders. The results show that using max-min SINR power allocation achieves the best reliability, at the expense of lower sum spectral efficiency.","Massive MIMO is a crucial factor in low-latency communications, thanks to its high spatial degrees of freedom.

"Deep LSTM is an ideal candidate for text recognition. However text recognition involves some initial image processing steps like segmentation of lines and words which can induce error to the recognition system. Without segmentation, learning very long range context is difficult and becomes computationally intractable. Therefore, alternative soft decisions are needed at the pre-processing level. This paper proposes a hybrid text recognizer using a deep recurrent neural network with multiple layers of abstraction and long range context along with a language model to verify the performance of the deep neural network. In this paper we construct a multi-hypotheses tree architecture with candidate segments of line sequences from different segmentation algorithms at its different branches. The deep neural network is trained on perfectly segmented data and tests each of the candidate segments, generating unicode sequences. In the verification step, these unicode sequences are validated using a sub-string match with the language model and best first search is used to find the best possible combination of alternative hypothesis from the tree structure. Thus the verification framework using language models eliminates wrong segmentation outputs and filters recognition errors.","Continuation: To substantiate this claim, we conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of Deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in text recognition tasks. We compared the Deep LSTM model against conventional LSTM and other popular neural network architectures across various datasets, including both printed and handwritten text corpuses. The metrics for evaluation were accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, while considering the impact of dataset complexity and noise levels. Additionally, we investigated the robustness of the Deep LSTM model in the face of adversarial attacks and its ability to generalize across different languages and scripts. Our findings indicate that Deep LSTMs, with their hierarchical structure and enhanced memory capacity, outperform standard LSTMs and other baseline models, particularly in contexts with long-term dependencies and intricate patterns. The results also show that Deep LSTMs are less prone to overfitting and demonstrate superior transfer learning capabilities.

"Tracking the state of the conversation is a central component in task-oriented spoken dialogue systems. One such approach for tracking the dialogue state is slot carryover , where a model makes a binary decision if a slot from the context is relevant to the current turn. Previous work on the slot carryover task used models that made independent decisions for each slot. A close analysis of the results show that this approach results in poor performance over longer context dialogues. In this paper, we propose to jointly model the slots.

" This valuable asset, however, can also be a threat to an organization's confidentiality. Members of social networking websites expose not only their personal information, but also details about the organizations for which they work. In this paper we analyze several commercial organizations by mining data which their employees have exposed on Facebook, LinkedIn, and other publicly available sources. Using a web crawler designed for this purpose, we extract a network of informal social relationships among employees of a given target organization. Our results, obtained using centrality analysis and Machine Learning techniques applied to the structure of the informal relationships network, show that it is possible to identify leadership roles within the organization solely by this means. It is also possible to gain valuable non-trivial insights on an organization's structure by clustering its social network and gathering publicly available information on the employees within each cluster. Organizations wanting to conceal their internal structure, identity of leaders, location and specialization of branches offices, etc., must enforce strict policies to control the use of social media by their employees.

"Cybercriminals have found in online social networks a propitious medium to spread spam and malicious content. Existing techniques for detecting spam include predicting the trustworthiness of accounts and analyzing the content of these messages. However, advanced attackers can still successfully evade these defenses. Online social networks bring people who have personal connections or share common interests to form communities. In this paper, we first show that users within a networked community share some topics of interest. Moreover, content shared on these social network tend to propagate according to the interests of people. Dissemination paths may emerge where some communities post similar messages, based on the interests of those communities. Spam and other malicious content, on the other hand, follow different spreading patterns. In this paper, we follow this insight and present POISED , a system that leverages the differences in propagation between benign and malicious messages on social networks to identify spam and other unwanted content.

"Price differentiation describes a marketing strategy to determine the price of goods on the basis of a potential customer's attributes like location, financial status, possessions, or behavior. Several cases of online price differentiation have been revealed in recent years. For example, different pricing based on a user's location was discovered for online office supply chain stores and there were indications that offers for hotel rooms are priced higher for Apple users compared to Windows users at certain online booking websites. One potential source for relevant distinctive features are system fingerprints , i.e., a technique to recognize users' systems by identifying unique attributes such as the source IP address or system configuration. In this paper, we shed light on the ecosystem of pricing at online platforms and aim to detect if and how such platform providers make use of price differentiation based on digital system fingerprints. We designed and implemented an automated price scanner capable of disguising itself as an arbitrary system, leveraging real-world system fingerprints, and searched for price differences related to different features (e.g., user location, language setting, or operating system).

"This paper investigates the opportunities and limitations of adaptive virtual machine (VM) migration to reduce communication costs in a virtualized environment. We introduce a new formal model for the problem of online VM migration in two scenarios: (1) VMs can be migrated arbitrarily in the substrate network; e.g., a private cloud provider may have an incentive to reduce the overall communication cost in the network. (2) VMs can only be migrated within a given tenant; e.g., a user that was assigned a set of physical machines may exchange the functionality of the VMs on these machines. We propose a simple class of Destination-Swap algorithms which are based on an aggressive collocation strategy (inspired by splay datastructures) and which maintain a minimal and local amount of per-node (amortized cost) information to decide where to migrate a VM and how; thus, the algorithms react quickly to changes in the load. The algorithms come in two main flavors, an indirect and distributed variant which keeps existing VM placements local, and a direct variant which keeps the number of affected VMs small. We show that naturally, inter-tenant optimizations yield a larger potential for optimization, but generally also a tenant itself can improve its embedding. Moreover, there exists an interesting tradeoff between direct and indirect strategies: indirect variants are preferable under skewed and sparse communication patterns due to their locality properties.","We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive VM migration in reducing communication costs in a virtualized environment. Our results show that adaptive VM migration can significantly reduce communication overhead by dynamically moving VMs to different physical hosts based on workload and network conditions. However, we also identified limitations, such as increased migration time and potential impact on application performance during migration. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the potential benefits and challenges of adaptive VM migration in virtualized environments. Our study provides valuable insights for future research and development of adaptive VM migration techniques.",no
"Objects and actors are communicating state machines, offering and consuming different services at different points in their lifecycle. Two complementary challenges arise when programming such systems. When objects interact, their state machines must be ""compatible,"" so that services are requested only when they are available. Dually, when objects refine other objects, their state machines must be ""compliant,"" so that services are honoured whenever they are promised. In this paper we show how the idea of multiparty compatibility from the session types literature can be applied to both of these problems. We present an untyped language in which concurrent objects are checked automatically for compatibility and compliance. For simple objects, checking can be exhaustive and has the feel of a type system. More complex objects can be partially validated via test cases, leading to a methodology closer to continuous testing. Our proof-of-concept implementation is limited in some important respects, but demonstrates the potential value of the approach and the relationship to existing software development practices.","This paper discusses challenges in systems where objects and actors behave as state machines, interacting and refining each other.

" The power graph fused lasso (PGFL) segments a matrix by exploiting a known graphical structure, G , over the rows and columns.

" Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, the precision of bounding box regression remains unsatisfactory, hence limiting performance in object detection. We observe that precise localization requires careful placement of each side of the bounding box. However, the mainstream approach, which focuses on predicting centers and sizes, is not the most effective way to accomplish this task, especially when there exists displacements with large variance between the anchors and the targets. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, named as Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL), where each side of the bounding box is respectively localized with a dedicated network branch. Moreover, to tackle the difficulty of precise localization in the presence of displacements with large variance, we further propose a two-step localization scheme, which first predicts a range of movement through bucket prediction and then pinpoints the precise position within the predicted bucket. We test the proposed method on both two-stage and single-stage detection frameworks. Replacing the standard bounding box regression branch with the proposed design leads to significant improvements on Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN, by 3.0, 1.6, and 0.9, respectively.

" How a material interacts with different fluids at different Reynold numbers has to be studied before it is passed over to the manufacturing process. In addition, examining the same model not only for different fluids but also for different solids allows to optimize the choice of materials for construction even better. A possible answer on this demand is parameter-dependent discretization. Furthermore, low-rank techniques can reduce the complexity needed to compute approximations to parameter-dependent fluid-structure interaction discretizations. Low-rank methods have been applied to parameter-dependent linear fluid-structure interaction discretizations. The linearity of the operators involved allows to translate the resulting equations to a single matrix equation. The solution is approximated by a low-rank method. In this paper, we propose a new method that extends this framework to nonlinear parameter-dependent fluid-structure interaction problems by means of the Newton iteration. The parameter set is split into disjoint subsets. On each subset, the Newton approximation of the problem related to the upper median parameter is computed and serves as initial guess for one Newton step on the whole subset. This Newton step yields a matrix equation whose solution can be approximated by a low-rank method. The resulting method requires a smaller number of Newton steps if compared with a direct approach that applies the Newton iteration to the separate problems consecutively. In the experiments considered, the proposed method allowed to compute a low-rank approximation within a twentieth of the time used by the direct approach.","This study extends the investigation of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models by considering the linear response of materials subject to fluid forces in both aerospace engineering and boat building applications.

" One method of adding charging stations is to install them at parking spots.

First, we analyze two firms who compete over installing stations under government set mandates or subsidies. Given the cost of constructing spots and the competitiveness of markets, we find it is ambiguous whether setting higher mandates or higher subsidies for spot construction leads to better aggregate outcomes. Second, we look at a system operator who faces uncertainty on the size of the EV market.

"A multi-armed bandit with finitely many arms is studied when each arm is a homogeneous Markov process on an underlying finite state space. The transition law of one of the arms, referred to as the odd arm, is different from the common transition law of all other arms. A learner, who has no knowledge of the above transition laws, has to devise a sequential test to identify the index of the odd arm as quickly as possible, subject to an upper bound on the probability of error. For this problem, we derive an asymptotic lower bound on the expected stopping time of any sequential test of the learner, where the asymptotics is as the probability of error vanishes.

The transition law of one of the arms, referred to as the odd arm, is different from the common transition law of all other arms. A learner, who has no knowledge of the above transition laws, has to devise a sequential test to identify the index of the odd arm as quickly as possible, subject to an upper bound on the probability of error.

" Structural and dynamical similarities of different real networks suggest that some universal laws might accurately describe the dynamics of these networks, albeit the nature and common origin of such laws remain elusive. Here we show that the causal network representing the large-scale structure of spacetime in our accelerating universe is a power-law graph with strong clustering, similar to many complex networks such as the Internet, social, or biological networks. We prove that this structural similarity is a consequence of the asymptotic equivalence between the large-scale growth dynamics of complex networks and causal networks. This equivalence suggests that unexpectedly similar laws govern the dynamics of complex networks and spacetime in the universe, with implications to network science and cosmology.","
Such a framework has far-reaching implications for understanding the structure and behavior of complex systems across a wide range of domains, from social networks to biological networks.

Ultimately, we succeeded in using Vivado-HLS to produce router and NoC modules that are exact cycle- and bit-accurate replacements of our reference RTL-based router and NoC modules. Furthermore, the routers and NoCs resulting from HLS and RTL are comparable in resource utilization and critical path delay.

" Existing techniques for detecting spam include predicting the trustworthiness of accounts and analyzing the content of these messages. However, advanced attackers can still successfully evade these defenses. Online social networks bring people who have personal connections or share common interests to form communities. In this paper, we first show that users within a networked community share some topics of interest. Moreover, content shared on these social network tend to propagate according to the interests of people. Dissemination paths may emerge where some communities post similar messages, based on the interests of those communities. Spam and other malicious content, on the other hand, follow different spreading patterns. In this paper, we follow this insight and present POISED , a system that leverages the differences in propagation between benign and malicious messages on social networks to identify spam and other unwanted content. We test our system on a dataset of 1.3M tweets collected from 64K users, and we show that our approach is effective in detecting malicious messages, reaching 91 precision and 93 recall. We also show that POISED 's detection is more comprehensive than previous systems, by comparing it to three state-of-the-art spam detection systems that have been proposed by the research community in the past. POISED significantly outperforms each of these systems. Moreover, through simulations, we show how POISED is effective in the early detection of spam messages and how it is resilient against two well-known adversarial machine learning attacks.","

The proliferation of online social networks has unwittingly created a breeding ground for cybercriminals to disseminate spam and malicious content. The open nature of these communities, coupled with the ease of account creation and anonymity, allows cybercriminals to spread their malicious activities with relative ease. The detection of spam messages in these networks poses a significant challenge due to the sheer volume of content being shared and the cunning tactics employed by cybercriminals to evade detection. To address this issue, research has focused on developing sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques to detect and filter out spam messages. However, these approaches often fall short as cybercriminals adapt and evolve their tactics to stay ahead of detection. The development of effective spam detection methods that can keep pace with the evolving tactics of cybercriminals is a pressing concern",no

"We design and experimentally validate a real-time control system for battery energy storage systems (BESSs) to provide frequency control and voltage support to power grids.

The initial power set-points are obtained based on the traditional droop control approach. The final power set-points calculation is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem. A convex reformulation of the original control problem is proposed. We prove that the proposed convex optimization gives the global optimal solution to the initial nonconvex problem. Finally, we improve the performance of this algorithm by reformulating and discretizing the feasible region of the optimization model.

" A seller has infinite copies of n products represented by nodes in a graph. There are m consumers, each has a budget and wants to buy two products. Consumers are represented by weighted edges. Given the prices of products, each consumer will buy both products she wants, at the given price, if she can afford to. Our objective is to help the seller price the products to maximize her profit. This problem is called graph vertex pricing (GVP) problem and has resisted several recent attempts despite its current simple solution. This motivates the study of this problem on special classes of graphs. In this paper, we study this problem on a large class of graphs such as graphs with bounded treewidth, bounded genus and k -partite graphs. We show that there exists an FPTAS for GVP on graphs with bounded treewidth. This result is also extended to an FPTAS for the more general single-minded pricing problem. On bounded genus graphs we present a PTAS and show that GVP is NP -hard even on planar graphs. We study the Sherali-Adams hierarchy applied to a natural Integer Program formulation that ( 1 ) -approximates the optimal solution of GVP . Sherali-Adams hierarchy has gained much interest recently as a possible approach to develop new approximation algorithms. We show that, when the input graph has bounded treewidth or bounded genus, applying a constant number of rounds of Sherali-Adams hierarchy makes the integrality gap of this natural LP arbitrarily small, thus giving a ( 1 ) -approximate solution to the original GVP instance. On k -partite graphs, we present a constant-factor approximation algorithm. We further improve the approximation factors for paths, cycles and graphs with degree at most three.","In this study, we address the computational challenges posed by large class graphs.

Nanoscale devices can be difficult to study and improve as they're too small to reflect enough light to be viewed clearly. Researchers from UC Riverside have built a device that squeezes tungsten lamp light into a 6-nanometer spot at the end of a silver nanowire to produce color imaging at an unprecedented level. The system records changes in beam shape and color as the nanowire's tip passes over objects. It is able to create color photos of carbon nanotubes. The technology could play an important role in developing more uniform nanomaterials and help improve other areas of research where this level of resolution hasn't been available.,"Studying and improving nanoscale devices can be challenging due to their small size and inability to reflect enough light for clear viewing.

" It has broad applications in vision, graphics, and robotics. Our study indicates that the widely-used generative adversarial network (GAN) may learn ""incomplete"" representations due to the single-pathway framework: an encoder-decoder network followed by a discriminator network. We propose CR-GAN to address this problem. In addition to the single reconstruction path, we introduce a generation sideway to maintain the completeness of the learned embedding space. The two learning pathways collaborate and compete in a parameter-sharing manner, yielding considerably improved generalization ability to ""unseen"" dataset. More importantly, the two-pathway framework makes it possible to combine both labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learning, which further enriches the embedding space for realistic generations. The experimental results prove that CR-GAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially when generating from ""unseen"" inputs in wild conditions. 1 footnote 1 1 footnote 1 The code and pre-trained models are publicly available:","In this study, we approach the problem of generating multi-view images from single-view inputs by leveraging a learned embedding space.

The learned embedding is then utilized to reconstruct the input from novel viewpoints, preserving the consistency and accuracy of the original scene's details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of view synthesis quality and robustness to variations in input data.

Our approach utilizes simulated on-policy learning, where the agent learns by interacting with the environment while receiving feedback on its performance. This feedback is in the form of punishment signals for undesirable behaviors, such as deviations from the desired speed or steering angle, and rewards for safe and efficient driving.

" Quantum systems are subsystems of classical statistical systems. The Ising spins can represent macroscopic two-level observables, and the quantum subsystem employs suitable expectation values and correlations. We discuss static memory materials based on Ising spins for which boundary information can be transported through the bulk in a generalized equilibrium state. They can realize quantum operations as the Hadamard or CNOT-gate for the quantum subsystem. Classical probabilistic systems can account for the entanglement of quantum spins. An arbitrary unitary evolution for an arbitrary number of quantum spins can be described by static memory materials for an infinite number of Ising spins which may, in turn, correspond to continuous variables or fields. We discuss discrete subsets of unitary operations realized by a finite number of Ising spins. They may be useful for new computational structures. We suggest that features of quantum computation or more general probabilistic computation may be realized by neural networks, neuromorphic computing or perhaps even the brain. This does neither require small isolated entities nor very low temperature. In these systems the processing of probabilistic information can be more general than for static memory materials. We propose a general formalism for probabilistic computing for which deterministic computing and quantum computing are special limiting cases.","

Abstract— A bit-quantum map provides a novel approach to representing probabilistic information in classical and quantum systems. This map relates Ising spins or classical bits to quantum spins or qubits, enabling a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between classical and quantum phenomena. By leveraging the properties of quantum entanglement and superposition, the bit-quantum map offers a powerful tool for analyzing and optimizing complex systems that cannot be fully captured by classical methods. We demonstrate the versatility and efficiency of the bit-quantum map through applications in quantum computing, machine learning, and spin models. Our results show that the map provides a robust framework for studying the classical-quantum transition and paves the way for further investigations into the intricate relationships between classical and quantum systems. In this study, we focus on the bit-quantum map's ability to capture the inherent quantumness of Ising spins",no

" Many algorithms try to predict model performance of the pruned sub-nets by introducing various evaluation methods. But they are either inaccurate or very complicated for general application.

Despite this limitation of static visualizations, there are still many cases where visualizations are limited to being static (e.g., visualizations on presentation slides or posters). We believe in many of these cases, static visualizations will benefit from allowing users to perform interactive tasks on them. Inspired by the introduction of numerous commercial personal augmented reality (AR) devices, we propose an AR solution that allows interactive data exploration of datasets on static visualizations.

" Recent works based on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) have demonstrated excellent results for this difficult problem. While residual connections within FCNs have proved to be quintessential for achieving high accuracy, we re-analyze this design choice in the context of improving both the accuracy and the efficiency over the state-of-the-art. In particular, we make the following contributions: (a) We propose gated skip connections with per-channel learnable parameters to control the data flow for each channel within the module within the macro-module. (b) We introduce a hybrid network that combines the HourGlass and U-Net architectures which minimizes the number of identity connections within the network and increases the performance for the same parameter budget. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the MPII and LSP datasets. In addition, with a reduction of 3 in model size and complexity, we show no decrease in performance when compared to the original HourGlass network.","In this work, we propose a novel framework for human pose estimation that leverages advanced deep learning techniques to achieve both high accuracy and efficiency. Our approach utilizes a multi-stage convolutional neural network architecture that progressively refines pose estimates to address the challenges of articulated human motion and occlusion. To facilitate the training of our model, we introduce a large-scale dataset with diverse poses and environments, annotated with high precision. We also implement a set of data augmentation techniques that enhance the model's robustness to variations in body shapes, clothing, and lighting conditions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, particularly in complex scenarios with multiple interacting persons and dynamic activities. Moreover, our efficient network design enables real-time performance on consumer-grade hardware, making it suitable for applications in augmented reality, surveillance, and sports analysis.",no

" However, they pose mental health risks for citizens in terms of detachment from natural light, sky view, greenery, and environmental landscapes. The housing economy and rent structure in different areas may or may not take account of such environmental factors. In this paper, we build a computer vision based pipeline to study factors like sky visibility, greenery in the sidewalks, and dominant colors present in streets from a pedestrian's perspective. We show that people in lower economy classes may suffer from lower sky visibility, whereas people in higher economy classes may suffer from lack of greenery in their environment, both of which could be possibly addressed by implementing rent restructuring schemes.","This rapid proliferation of high-rise buildings has raised concerns regarding the impact on sky visibility and the wellbeing of the people living in Dhaka.

" The proposed architecture consists of multiple Echo State Networks to predict blood glucose levels combined with Model Predictive Controller for planning. Echo State Network is a version of recurrent neural networks which allows us to learn long term dependencies in the input of time series data in an online manner. Additionally, we address the quantification of uncertainty for a more robust control. Here, we used ensembles of Echo State Networks to capture model (epistemic) uncertainty. We evaluated the approach with the FDA-approved UVaPadova Type 1 Diabetes simulator and compared the results against baseline algorithms such as Basal-Bolus controller and Deep Q-learning. The results suggest that the model-based reinforcement learning algorithm can perform equally or better than the baseline algorithms for the majority of virtual Type 1 Diabetes person profiles tested.","To further explore the efficacy of model-based reinforcement learning for assisting individuals with Type 1 Diabetes, we incorporate the use of echo state networks (ESNs) as a means to enhance the predictive capabilities of our system.

" Reservoir computing is a growing paradigm for simplified training of recurrent neural networks, with a high potential for hardware implementations. Numerous experiments in optics and electronics yield comparable performance to digital state-of-the-art algorithms. Many of the most recent works in the field focus on large-scale photonic systems, with tens of thousands of physical nodes and arbitrary interconnections. While this trend significantly expands the potential applications of photonic reservoir computing, it also complicates the optimisation of the high number of hyper hyp parameters of the system. Methods. In this work, we propose the use of Bayesian optimisation for efficient exploration of the hyper hyp parameter space in a minimum number of iteration. Results. We test this approach on a previously reported large-scale experimental system, compare it to the commonly used grid search, and report notable improvements in performance and the number of experimental iterations required to optimise the hyper hyp parameters. Conclusion. Bayesian optimisation thus has the potential to become the standard method for tuning the hyper hyp parameters in photonic reservoir computing.","
The proposed method combines large-scale photonic and Bayesian optimization for efficient optimization of a macroscopic system. The photonic component enables the exploration of a vast solution space, while the Bayesian optimization employs a surrogate model to posterior distributions over the system's parameters. The proposed method is evaluated using a testbed consisting of a photonic integrated circuit and a machine learning framework. The results show that the method is able to efficiently optimize the system's parameters, leading to improved performance compared to traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, the use of photonic devices enables the exploration of a larger solution space, leading to the discovery of previously unknown optima. The proposed method has important implications for the optimization of complex systems in a wide range of fields, including but not limited to, material science, chemistry, and biology.

Automation has replaced human labor in routine tasks throughout the last couple of centuries without destroying entire occupations. It has even created new types of jobs. However, as technology improves, it seems inevitable that the number of jobs will start to decrease.

"The main objective of this paper is to define a logic for reasoning about distributed time-stamped claims.

We introduce the Time-Stamped Claim Logic including a sound and complete sequent calculus that allows one to reduce the size of the collected set of evidence and removes inconsistencies, i.e., the logic ensures that the result is consistent with respect to the trust relations considered. In order to show how Time-Stamped Claim Logic can be used in practice, we consider a concrete cyber-attribution case study.

"Very deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have greatly improved the performance on various image restoration tasks. However, this comes at a price of increasing computational burden, which limits their practical usages. We believe that some corrupted image regions are inherently easier to restore than others since the distortion and content vary within an image. To this end, we propose Path-Restore, a multi-path CNN with a pathfinder that could dynamically select an appropriate route for each image region. We train the pathfinder using reinforcement learning with a difficulty-regulated reward, which is related to the performance, complexity and ""the difficulty of restoring a region."" We conduct experiments on denoising and mixed restoration tasks. The results show that our method could achieve comparable or superior performance to existing approaches with less computational cost.

" We propose and analyze a comprehensive set of features and develop an accurate model to predict future popularity of a meme given its early spreading patterns. Our paper provides the first comprehensive comparison of existing predictive frameworks. We categorize our features into three groups: influence of early adopters, community concentration, and characteristics of adoption time series. We find that features based on community structure are the most powerful predictors of future success. We also find that early popularity of a meme is not a good predictor of its future popularity, contrary to common belief. Our methods outperform other approaches, particularly in the task of detecting very popular or unpopular memes.","

Our findings show that the early spreading patterns of successful memes exhibit distinct characteristics that can be used to predict their future popularity. Specifically, we identify a set of empirical laws that govern the growth of meme popularity, which can be used to forecast the likelihood of a meme becoming viral. These laws are based on the structural properties of the underlying social networks, such as the degree distribution and clustering coefficient, as well as the temporal dynamics of meme spreading, such as the rate of adoption and abandonment. By analyzing these factors, we can accurately predict the popularity of a meme up to 90% in some cases.

"Microfluidic devices are utilized to control and direct flow behavior in a wide variety of applications, particularly in medical diagnostics. A particularly popular form of microfluidics - called inertial microfluidic flow sculpting - involves placing a sequence of pillars to controllably deform an initial flow field into a desired one. Inertial flow sculpting can be formally defined as an inverse problem, where one identifies a sequence of pillars (chosen, with replacement, from a finite set of pillars, each of which produce a specific transformation) whose composite transformation results in a user-defined desired transformation. Endemic to most such problems in engineering, inverse problems are usually quite computationally intractable, with most traditional approaches based on search and optimization strategies. In this paper, we pose this inverse problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. We train a DoubleDQN agent to learn from this environment. The results suggest that learning is possible using a DoubleDQN model with the success frequency reaching 90 in 200,000 episodes and the rewards converging. While most of the results are obtained by fixing a particular target flow shape to simplify the learning problem, we later demonstrate how to transfer the learning of an agent based on one target shape to another, i.e. from one design to another and thus be useful for a generic design of a flow shape.","Microfluidic devices, which control flow for medical diagnostics, can be optimized using inertial microfluidic flow sculpting.

"A classical problem in comparative genomics is to compute the rearrangement distance, that is the minimum number of large-scale rearrangements required to transform a given genome into another given genome. While the most traditional approaches in this area are family-based , i.e., require the classification of DNA fragments of both genomes into families , more recently an alternative model was proposed, which, instead of family classification, simply uses the pairwise similarities between DNA fragments of both genomes to compute their rearrangement distance. This model represents structural rearrangements by the generic double cut and join (DCJ) operation and is then called family-free DCJ distance . It computes the DCJ distance between the two genomes by searching for a matching of their genes based on the given pairwise similarities, therefore helping to find gene homologies. The drawback is that its computation is NP-hard. Another point is that the family-free DCJ distance must correspond to a maximal matching of the genes, due to the fact that unmatched genes are just ignored: maximizing the matching prevents the free lunch artifact of having empty or almost empty matchings giving the smaller distances. In this paper, besides DCJ operations, we allow content-modifying operations of insertions and deletions of DNA segments and propose a new and more general family-free genomic distance. In our model we use the pairwise similarities to assign weights to both matched and unmatched genes, so that an optimal solution does not necessarily maximize the matching. Our model then results in a natural family-free genomic distance , that takes into consideration all given genes and has a search space composed of matchings of any size. We provide an efficient ILP formulation to solve it, by extending the previous formulations for computing family-based genomic distances from Shao et al. (J. Comput. Biol. , 2015) and Bohnenkamper et al. (Proc. of RECOMB , 2020). Our experiments show that the ILP can handle not only bacterial genomes, but also fungi and insects, or sets of chromosomes of mammals and plants. In a comparison study of six fruit fly genomes, we obtained accurate results.","Comparative genomics seeks to compute the rearrangement distance between two genomes, traditionally done through family-based approaches but also through a newer family-free model based on pairwise similarities.

" Considering the practical scenario of nonlinear energy harvesting (EH), we adopt the realistic nonlinear EH model for analysis. To address the critical nonlinearity issue due to the saturation, we propose to use multiple EH circuits in parallel.

In this paper, we first derive the optimal solution for any number of EH circuits. Then we study how the number of EH circuits required to avoid the saturation should be determined. From the obtained results, we draw useful and interesting insights into the SWIPT system with nonlinear EH. Numerical results demonstrate that employing multiple EH circuits substantially enhances the SWIPT performance with nonlinear EH.","In this study, we develop a novel optimization framework for SWIPT systems that considers both the transmit power allocation at the transmitter and the power splitting at the receiver.

"Air-gapped systems are systems that aren't connected to any network. These systems generally run critical operations or have sensitive data, so limiting exposure to outside networks is a necessary security measure. Mordechai Guri and his team have been researching methods of extracting data from air-gapped systems and have developed a plethora of techniques over the years. A new technique involves installing malware onto the air-gapped machine which makes the fans inside the computer vibrate at certain frequencies. These frequencies can be recorded using a phone's accelerometer and then decoded later on. While the technique is innovative, it is extremely slow, extracting data at half a bit per second. Real-life attackers are likely to use faster methods.","Despite being isolated from online threats, air-gapped systems are not entirely immune to security risks. Experts warn that these systems, often found in secure government installations, military operations, and critical infrastructure, can still be compromised through physical access or sophisticated cyber espionage techniques.

"This paper addresses the problem of real-time action recognition in trimmed videos, for which deep neural networks have defined the state-of-the-art performance in the recent literature. For attaining higher recognition accuracies with efficient computations, researchers have addressed the various aspects of limitations in the recognition pipeline. This includes network architecture, the number of input streams (where additional streams augment the color information), the cost function to be optimized, in addition to others. The literature has always aimed, though, at assigning the adopted network (or networks, in case of multiple streams) the task of recognizing the whole number of action classes in the dataset at hand. We propose to train multiple specialized module networks instead. Each module is trained to recognize a subset of the action classes. Towards this goal, we present a dissimilarity-based optimized procedure for distributing the action classes over the modules, which can be trained simultaneously offline.

" How a material interacts with different fluids at different Reynold numbers has to be studied before it is passed over to the manufacturing process. In addition, examining the same model not only for different fluids but also for different solids allows to optimize the choice of materials for construction even better. A possible answer on this demand is parameter-dependent discretization. Furthermore, low-rank techniques can reduce the complexity needed to compute approximations to parameter-dependent fluid-structure interaction discretizations. Low-rank methods have been applied to parameter-dependent linear fluid-structure interaction discretizations. The linearity of the operators involved allows to translate the resulting equations to a single matrix equation. The solution is approximated by a low-rank method.

The parameter set is split into disjoint subsets. On each subset, the Newton approximation of the problem related to the upper median parameter is computed and serves as initial guess for one Newton step on the whole subset.

The resulting method requires a smaller number of Newton steps if compared with a direct approach that applies the Newton iteration to the separate problems consecutively. In the experiments considered, the proposed method allowed to compute a low-rank approximation within a twentieth of the time used by the direct approach.","

"In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation of the efficacy of knowledge distillation and its dependence on student and teacher architectures. Starting with the observation that more accurate teachers often don't make good teachers, we attempt to tease apart the factors that affect knowledge distillation performance. We find crucially that larger models do not often make better teachers. We show that this is a consequence of mismatched capacity, and that small students are unable to mimic large teachers. We find typical ways of circumventing this (such as performing a sequence of knowledge distillation steps) to be ineffective. Finally, we show that this effect can be mitigated by stopping the teacher's training early.

" In safety-critical systems, it is paramount that the learner's actions do not violate the safety constraints at any stage of the learning process. In this paper, we study a stochastic bandit optimization problem where the unknown payoff and constraint functions are sampled from Gaussian Processes (GPs) first considered in . We develop a safe variant of GP-UCB called SGP-UCB, with necessary modifications to respect safety constraints at every round. The algorithm has two distinct phases. The first phase seeks to estimate the set of safe actions in the decision set, while the second phase follows the GP-UCB decision rule. Our main contribution is to derive the first sub-linear regret bounds for this problem. We numerically compare SGP-UCB against existing safe Bayesian GP optimization algorithms.","

Such applications pose challenging problems for machine learning and artificial intelligence researchers, as the learner must carefully balance exploration and exploitation to maximize the cumulative reward while avoiding dangerous states or actions that could lead to catastrophic consequences. In this article, we propose a novel approach that combines model-based reinforcement learning with robust optimization techniques to address these challenges. Our approach learns a probabilistic model of the system's payoff function and safety constraints, and then solves a constrained optimization problem at each time step to determine the optimal decision that maximizes the expected cumulative reward while satisfying the safety constraints. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark problems and show that it significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both cumulative reward and safety. Our results demonstrate the potential of our approach for applications in areas such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and medical decision-making. Imagine that you are continuing from the",no

" However, this methodology can be expensive if the convex hull contains many facets. For example, the convex hull of n -symbol Huffman trees is known to have exponentially many facets (,). We get around this difficulty by exploiting extended formulations (,), which encode the polytope of combinatorial objects in a higher dimensional ""extended"" space with only polynomially many facets. We develop a general framework for converting extended formulations into efficient online algorithms with good relative loss bounds. We present applications of our framework to online learning of Huffman trees and permutations. The regret bounds of the resulting algorithms are within a factor of O (log (n of the state-of-the-art specialized algorithms for permutations, and depending on the loss regimes, improve on or match the state-of-the-art for Huffman trees. Our method is general and can be applied to other combinatorial objects.","In this study, we extend the current framework by incorporating a novel encoding scheme for combinatorial structures within a polytope representation, which allows for more efficient projections. Specifically, we propose an algorithm that encodes combinatorial objects as vertices of a carefully constructed polytope. This encoding not only retains the combinatorial properties of the objects but also facilitates an elegant geometric interpretation of the learning process. The polytope framework enables us to employ multiplicative update rules that are naturally confined to the feasible region, thus eliminating the need for explicit post-update projections. We show that our encoding scheme preserves linearity and allows for a direct application of well-known optimization techniques in the resulting polytope space. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of both computational efficiency and convergence rates. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence behavior within the encoded polytope space, which reveals insights into the geometric structure of combinatorial learning problems.",no

"The last decade has seen a surge of interest in continual learning (CL), and a variety of methods have been developed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. However, most prior work has focused on tasks with static data, while CL on sequential data has remained largely unexplored. Here we address this gap in two ways. First, we evaluate the performance of established CL methods when applied to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We primarily focus on elastic weight consolidation, which is limited by a stability-plasticity trade-off, and explore the particularities of this trade-off when using sequential data. We show that high working memory requirements, but not necessarily sequence length, lead to an increased need for stability at the cost of decreased performance on subsequent tasks. Second, to overcome this limitation we employ a recent method based on hypernetworks and apply it to RNNs to address catastrophic forgetting on sequential data. By generating the weights of a main RNN in a task-dependent manner, our approach disentangles stability and plasticity, and outperforms alternative methods in a range of experiments.

In this framework, we propose a set of notions of stability for generic discrete-event systems in the max-plus algebra.

"Deep LSTM is an ideal candidate for text recognition. However text recognition involves some initial image processing steps like segmentation of lines and words which can induce error to the recognition system. Without segmentation, learning very long range context is difficult and becomes computationally intractable. Therefore, alternative soft decisions are needed at the pre-processing level. This paper proposes a hybrid text recognizer using a deep recurrent neural network with multiple layers of abstraction and long range context along with a language model to verify the performance of the deep neural network. In this paper we construct a multi-hypotheses tree architecture with candidate segments of line sequences from different segmentation algorithms at its different branches. The deep neural network is trained on perfectly segmented data and tests each of the candidate segments, generating unicode sequences. In the verification step, these unicode sequences are validated using a sub-string match with the language model and best first search is used to find the best possible combination of alternative hypothesis from the tree structure. Thus the verification framework using language models eliminates wrong segmentation outputs and filters recognition errors.","In this study, we investigate the performance of Deep LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks in the context of text recognition tasks.

" In this paper, we conduct a qualitative study to explore why email spoofing is still possible after years of efforts to design, develop, and promote anti-spoofing protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). Previous research shows that the adoption rates of anti-spoofing protocols are still very low. To understand the reasons behind the slow adoption, we conduct a user study with 9 email administrators from different institutions. The results show that email administrators are aware of the weaknesses of these protocols and believe the current protocol adoption lacks the crucial mass due to the protocol defects, weak incentives, and practical deployment challenges. Based on these results, we discuss the key implications to protocol designers, email providers and users, and future research directions to mitigate the email spoofing threats.","In order to mitigate the risk of email spoofing and prevent phishing attacks, various anti-spoofing protocols have been developed.

" One method of adding charging stations is to install them at parking spots. While there are costs to constructing spots with chargers and they preclude regular internal combustion engine (ICE) drivers from using these spots, EV drivers may have a higher valuation for these spots due to their parking and charging demand. We look at two models for how decisions surrounding investment in charging stations on existing parking spots may be undertaken. First, we analyze two firms who compete over installing stations under government set mandates or subsidies. Given the cost of constructing spots and the competitiveness of markets, we find it is ambiguous whether setting higher mandates or higher subsidies for spot construction leads to better aggregate outcomes. Second, we look at a system operator who faces uncertainty on the size of the EV market. If they are risk neutral, we find a relatively small change in the uncertainty of the EV market can lead to large changes in the optimal charging capacity.","To address this challenge, this study proposes innovative approaches to enhance charging infrastructure for EVs in urban settings.

"We design and experimentally validate a real-time control system for battery energy storage systems (BESSs) to provide frequency control and voltage support to power grids. The objective of the control system is to utilize the full power capability of the BESSs to provide ancillary services. We take into account the dynamic capability curve of the DC-AC converter and the security requirements of the BESSs as constrains of the control system. The initial power set-points are obtained based on the traditional droop control approach. The final power set-points calculation is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem. A convex reformulation of the original control problem is proposed. We prove that the proposed convex optimization gives the global optimal solution to the initial nonconvex problem. Finally, we improve the performance of this algorithm by reformulating and discretizing the feasible region of the optimization model. We achieve a 100 ms update time of the controller setpoint and experimentally validate the real-time control system in the utility-scale 720 kVA 560 kWh BESS on EPFL campus.","

This paper presents a novel real-time control system for battery energy storage systems (BESSs) that addresses the urgent need for frequency control and voltage support in modern power grids. By leveraging the latest advances in machine learning and control theory, our proposed system is capable of ensuring grid stability and reliability while maximizing the lifespan of the batteries. The proposed control system is designed to operate in real-time, allowing it to respond rapidly to changes in grid conditions. This is achieved through a combination of model predictive control (MPC) and optimal control algorithms, which work together to optimize the battery's state of charge and power output. The system is also equipped with advanced fault detection and recovery mechanisms to ensure that it can operate safely and efficiently even in the presence of disturbances or failures. Experimental validation of the proposed control system is carried out using a 100 kWh BESS test",no

" Existing techniques for detecting spam include predicting the trustworthiness of accounts and analyzing the content of these messages. However, advanced attackers can still successfully evade these defenses. Online social networks bring people who have personal connections or share common interests to form communities. In this paper, we first show that users within a networked community share some topics of interest. Moreover, content shared on these social network tend to propagate according to the interests of people. Dissemination paths may emerge where some communities post similar messages, based on the interests of those communities.

" We argue that in spite of a lack of federal investment, large amounts of publicly available data offer scientists an opportunity to measure a range of firearm-related behaviors. Given the diversity of available data - including news coverage, social media, web forums, online advertisements, and Internet searches (to name a few) - there are ample opportunities for scientists to study everything from trends in particular types of gun violence to gun-related behaviors (such as purchases and safety practices) to public understanding of and sentiment towards various gun violence reduction measures. Science has been sidelined in the gun violence debate for too long. Scientists must tap the big media datastream and help resolve this crisis.","
While the scientific method has played a pivotal role in advancing public health interventions, the failure to apply this approach to gun violence prevention has resulted in a significant knowledge gap. The dearth of research on firearm-related behaviors and the root causes of gun violence has left policymakers and healthcare professionals ill-equipped to develop effective solutions to this pressing public health issue. The inability to collect even minimal data on gun violence has sidelined this critical public health concern, allowing the epidemic to continue unabated.

"This paper studies optimal pricing and rebalancing policies for Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems. We take a macroscopic planning perspective to tackle a profit maximization problem while ensuring that the system is load-balanced. We begin by describing the system using a dynamic fluid model to show the existence and stability of an equilibrium (i.e., load balance) through pricing policies. We then develop an optimization framework that allows us to find optimal policies in terms of pricing and rebalancing. We first maximize profit by only using pricing policies, then incorporate rebalancing, and finally we consider whether the solution is found sequentially or jointly. We apply each approach on a data-driven case study using real taxi data from New York City. Depending on which benchmarking solution we use, the joint problem (i.e., pricing and rebalancing) increases profits by 7 to 40.","This paper examines optimal pricing and rebalancing strategies for AMoD systems, aiming to maximize profit while ensuring load balance.

"Programs with randomization constructs is an active research topic, especially after the recent introduction of martingale-based analysis methods for their termination and runtimes.

To this goal, we devise a theory of supermartingales that overapproximate higher moments of runtime. These higher moments, combined with a suitable concentration inequality, yield useful upper bounds of tail probabilities.

" It is based on a greedy heuristic in which a 2-connected subgraph is iteratively extended with suitable open ears. The growth procedure is an adaptation of the breadth-first-search which efficiently manages to find open ears. Further, a heuristic function is defined for selecting the best ear out of a list of candidates. The performance of the basic approach is improved by adding a correction procedure which removes unnecessary nodes from a generated solution. Finally, randomization is included and the method is extended towards the GRASP metaheuristic. In our computational experiments, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to recently published results and show that the method is highly competitive and especially suitable for dense graphs.

"We present methods to serialize and deserialize tree ensembles that optimize inference latency when models are not already loaded into memory. This arises whenever models are larger than memory, but also systematically when models are deployed on low-resource devices, such as in the Internet of Things, or run as Web micro-services where resources are allocated on demand. Our packed serialized trees (PACSET) encode reference locality in the layout of a tree ensemble using principles from external memory algorithms. The layout interleaves correlated nodes across multiple trees, uses leaf cardinality to collocate the nodes on the most popular paths and is optimized for the IO blocksize.

" Many algorithms try to predict model performance of the pruned sub-nets by introducing various evaluation methods. But they are either inaccurate or very complicated for general application. In this work, we present a pruning method called EagleEye, in which a simple yet efficient evaluation component based on adaptive batch normalization is applied to unveil a strong correlation between different pruned DNN structures and their final settled accuracy. This strong correlation allows us to fast spot the pruned candidates with highest potential accuracy without actually fine-tuning them. This module is also general to plug-in and improve some existing pruning algorithms. EagleEye achieves better pruning performance than all of the studied pruning algorithms in our experiments. Concretely, to prune MobileNet V1 and ResNet-50, EagleEye outperforms all compared methods by up to 3.8. Even in the more challenging experiments of pruning the compact model of MobileNet V1, EagleEye achieves the highest accuracy of 70.9 with an overall 50 operations (FLOPs) pruned.

" However, existing methods have limited scalability. In this paper, instead of convolving with a dictionary shared by all samples, we propose the use of a sample-dependent dictionary in which each filter is a linear combination of a small set of base filters learned from data. This added flexibility allows a large number of sample-dependent patterns to be captured, which is especially useful in the handling of large or high-dimensional data sets. Computationally, the resultant model can be efficiently learned by online learning. Extensive experimental results on a number of data sets show that the proposed method outperforms existing CSC algorithms with significantly reduced time and space complexities.","
CSC has ability to learn a set of basis functions, or a dictionary, from a collection of input images. Each basis function in the dictionary corresponds to a specific pattern or feature present in the input images, such as edges or corners. By learning a shift-invariant dictionary, the basis functions are able to capture features that are translation invariant, allowing for the representation of images in a more robust and efficient manner. This is particularly useful in image processing tasks such as denoising, where a shift-invariant dictionary can be used to separate noise from the underlying image features. Furthermore, CSC can be used to apply a filter to the learned dictionary, allowing for the enhancement or suppression of specific features in the input images.",no

Motivated by these observations, we conduct a user study with 39 digital forensic investigators from both public and private sectors to document the challenges they faced in traditional and IoT digital forensics. We also created a tool, Stitcher , that addresses the technical challenges faced by investigators when handling IoT digital forensics investigation. We simulated an IoT crime that mimics sophisticated cybercriminals and invited our user study participants to utilize Stitcher to investigate the crime. The efficacy of Stitcher is confirmed by our study results where 96.2 of users indicated that Stitcher assisted them in handling the crime, and 61.5 of users who used Stitcher with its full features solved the crime completely."," In this research, we investigate the current state of digital forensic practices and tools for IoT devices and identifies gaps in the existing literature. Our findings indicate that the current tools and methods used in digital forensic investigations are largely inadequate for dealing with the complexities of IoT devices. We propose a new framework for digital forensic investigations of IoT devices that takes into account the unique characteristics of these devices and the challenges they present. Our proposed framework includes the development of new tools and methods specifically designed for IoT devices, as well as the integration of existing tools and methods to provide a comprehensive and effective approach to digital forensic investigations in the IoT era. Also, We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through a series of experiments using real-world IoT devices and simulate cybercrime scenarios.

" One method of adding charging stations is to install them at parking spots. While there are costs to constructing spots with chargers and they preclude regular internal combustion engine (ICE) drivers from using these spots, EV drivers may have a higher valuation for these spots due to their parking and charging demand. We look at two models for how decisions surrounding investment in charging stations on existing parking spots may be undertaken. First, we analyze two firms who compete over installing stations under government set mandates or subsidies. Given the cost of constructing spots and the competitiveness of markets, we find it is ambiguous whether setting higher mandates or higher subsidies for spot construction leads to better aggregate outcomes. Second, we look at a system operator who faces uncertainty on the size of the EV market. If they are risk neutral, we find a relatively small change in the uncertainty of the EV market can lead to large changes in the optimal charging capacity.","This study aims to examine the current state of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in urban areas.

" Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, the precision of bounding box regression remains unsatisfactory, hence limiting performance in object detection. We observe that precise localization requires careful placement of each side of the bounding box. However, the mainstream approach, which focuses on predicting centers and sizes, is not the most effective way to accomplish this task, especially when there exists displacements with large variance between the anchors and the targets. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, named as Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL), where each side of the bounding box is respectively localized with a dedicated network branch. Moreover, to tackle the difficulty of precise localization in the presence of displacements with large variance, we further propose a two-step localization scheme, which first predicts a range of movement through bucket prediction and then pinpoints the precise position within the predicted bucket. We test the proposed method on both two-stage and single-stage detection frameworks. Replacing the standard bounding box regression branch with the proposed design leads to significant improvements on Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN, by 3.0, 1.6, and 0.9, respectively. Code and models will be available at .","

However, these methods suffer from several limitations. First, they rely on anchor boxes that are predefined in a fixed size and shape, which can not adapt to various object scales and aspect ratios. Second, they require a large amount of annotated data to train, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Moreover, they often suffer from overfitting, especially when dealing with small objects or objects with low contrast. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel object detection framework based on CNN RetinaNet. Our approach utilizes a novel loss function that combines the focal loss and the IOU-based loss, which can better handle objects with varying sizes and orientations.

" However, existing methods have limited scalability. In this paper, instead of convolving with a dictionary shared by all samples, we propose the use of a sample-dependent dictionary in which each filter is a linear combination of a small set of base filters learned from data. This added flexibility allows a large number of sample-dependent patterns to be captured, which is especially useful in the handling of large or high-dimensional data sets. Computationally, the resultant model can be efficiently learned by online learning. Extensive experimental results on a number of data sets show that the proposed method outperforms existing CSC algorithms with significantly reduced time and space complexities.","In this research, we extend the current understanding of Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) by investigating its efficacy in learning optimized dictionaries for image reconstruction and classification tasks.

"The Count-Min sketch is an important and well-studied data summarization method. It allows one to estimate the count of any item in a stream using a small, fixed size data sketch. However, the accuracy of the sketch depends on characteristics of the underlying data. This has led to a number of count estimation procedures which work well in one scenario but perform poorly in others. A practitioner is faced with two basic, unanswered questions. Which variant should be chosen when the data is unknown? Given an estimate, is its error sufficiently small to be trustworthy? We provide answers to these questions. We derive new count estimators, including a provably optimal estimator, which best or match previous estimators in all scenarios. We also provide practical, tight error bounds at query time for both new and existing estimators. These error estimates also yield procedures to choose the sketch tuning parameters optimally, as they can extrapolate the error to different choices of sketch width and depth.

We develop a safe variant of GP-UCB called SGP-UCB, with necessary modifications to respect safety constraints at every round. The algorithm has two distinct phases.

"In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation of the efficacy of knowledge distillation and its dependence on student and teacher architectures. Starting with the observation that more accurate teachers often don't make good teachers, we attempt to tease apart the factors that affect knowledge distillation performance. We find crucially that larger models do not often make better teachers. We show that this is a consequence of mismatched capacity, and that small students are unable to mimic large teachers. We find typical ways of circumventing this (such as performing a sequence of knowledge distillation steps) to be ineffective. Finally, we show that this effect can be mitigated by stopping the teacher's training early. Our results generalize across datasets and models."," Our findings demonstrate that knowledge distillation consistently outperforms the student model, achieving an average gain of 10% across all tasks. Moreover, we show that the choice of teacher architecture has a significant impact on the performance of the distilled model, with the best-performing teacher achieving a 15% improvement over the worst-performing teacher.

In this paper, we propose Meta Segmentation Network (MSN) to solve this challenging problem. With the help of meta-learning, the fusion module of MSN is quite simple but effective. MSN can fast generate the weights of fusion layers through a simple meta-learner, requiring only a few training samples and epochs to converge. In addition, to avoid learning all branches from scratch, we further introduce a particular weight sharing mechanism to realize a fast knowledge adaptation and share the weights among multiple branches, resulting in the performance improvement and significant parameters reduction. The experimental results on two challenging ultra-resolution medical datasets BACH and ISIC show that MSN achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","Despite advancements in semantic segmentation, the field of medical ultra-resolution image segmentation still faces significant challenges.

" We aim to enhance the query recommendation experience for a commercial image search engine. Our proposed methodology incorporates current state-of-the-art practices from relevant literature - the use of generation-based sequence-to-sequence models that capture session context, and a multitask architecture that simultaneously optimizes the ranking of results. We extend this setup by driving the learning of such a model with captions of clicked images as the target, instead of using the subsequent query within the session. Since these captions tend to be linguistically richer, the reformulation mechanism can be seen as assistance to construct more descriptive queries. In addition, via the use of a pairwise loss for the secondary ranking task, we show that the generated reformulations are more diverse .","To better understand the dynamics of interactive search sessions, we investigate the ranking task generated by successive query reformulations.

" In practice, however, it is common to carefully hand-design the reward function to encourage a particular solution, or to derive it from demonstration data. In this paper explore how a rich environment can help to promote the learning of complex behavior. Specifically, we train agents in diverse environmental contexts, and find that this encourages the emergence of robust behaviours that perform well across a suite of tasks. We demonstrate this principle for locomotion - behaviours that are known for their sensitivity to the choice of reward. We train several simulated bodies on a diverse set of challenging terrains and obstacles, using a simple reward function based on forward progress. Using a novel scalable variant of policy gradient reinforcement learning, our agents learn to run, jump, crouch and turn as required by the environment without explicit reward-based guidance. A visual depiction of highlights of the learned behavior can be viewed in this video .","In recent years, there has been a growing interest in applying reinforcement learning to a wide range of real-world applications, including robotics, autonomous systems, and game playing.

" Most existing studies on product search focus on developing effective retrieval models that rank items by their likelihood to be purchased. They, however, ignore the problem that there is a gap between how systems and customers perceive the relevance of items. Without explanations, users may not understand why product search engines retrieve certain items for them, which consequentially leads to imperfect user experience and suboptimal system performance in practice. In this work, we tackle this problem by constructing explainable retrieval models for product search. Specifically, we propose to model the ""search and purchase"" behavior as a dynamic relation between users and items, and create a dynamic knowledge graph based on both the multi-relational product data and the context of the search session. Ranking is conducted based on the relationship between users and items in the latent space, and explanations are generated with logic inferences and entity soft matching on the knowledge graph.

" Such problems have applications, e.g., in computational biology. We provide a number of new and improved bounds for exact string reconstruction for settings where either the string or the queries are ""mixed-up."" For example, we show that a periodic (i.e., ""mixed-up string, S p k p , of smallest period p , where p p , can be reconstructed using O ( p lg n) substring queries, where is the alphabet size, if n S is unknown. We also show that we can reconstruct S after having been corrupted by a small number of errors d , measured by Hamming distance. In this case, we give an algorithm that uses O ( d p d p lg n d 1) queries. In addition, we show that a periodic string can be reconstructed using 2 lg n 2 p lg subsequence queries, and that general strings can be reconstructed using 2 lg n n lg subsequence queries, without knowledge of n in advance. This latter result improves the previous best, decades-old result, by Skiena and Sundaram. Finally, we believe we are the first to study the exact-learning query complexity for string reconstruction using jumbled-index queries, which are a ""mixed-up"" type of query that have received much attention of late.","

Our results show a strong connection between the query complexity and the structural properties of the string. In particular, we prove that for any string, the query complexity of exactly reconstructing it from adaptive substring queries is at least as high as the maximum length of its longest common prefix with any of its suffixes. We also demonstrate a family of strings for which the query complexity of exactly reconstructing them from adaptive subsequence queries is exponentially higher than the query complexity of exact reconstruction from adaptive substring queries. Furthermore, we show that for any string, the query complexity of exactly reconstructing it from adaptive jumbled-index queries is at least as high as the maximum number of consecutive symbols in the string that are in their correct positions. Our findings have important implications for the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for string reconstruction from adaptive queries, and highlight the intricate relationships between the structure of the string, the power of the query model",no

"This paper proposes a highly accurate algorithm to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a linear system from a single realization of the received signal. We assume that the linear system has a Gaussian matrix with one sided left correlation. The unknown entries of the signal and the noise are assumed to be independent and identically distributed with zero mean and can be drawn from any distribution. We use the ridge regression function of this linear model in company with tools and techniques adapted from random matrix theory to achieve, in closed form, accurate estimation of the SNR without prior statistical knowledge on the signal or the noise. Simulation results are provided, and show that the proposed method is very accurate.","The algorithm utilizes advanced statistical methods to analyze the received signal and extract key features that are indicative of the SNR. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly in low SNR scenarios.

" We show that, for a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network to approximate a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function approximation.

We show that shallow networks (i.e., networks whose depth does not depend on ) require ( poly ( 1 neurons while deep networks (i.e., networks whose depth grows with 1 ) require O ( polylog ( 1 neurons. We then extend these results to certain classes of important multivariate functions.

"The increasing adoption of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices present new challenges to digital forensic investigators and law enforcement agencies when investigation into cybercrime on these new platforms are required.

" It has broad applications in vision, graphics, and robotics.

The two learning pathways collaborate and compete in a parameter-sharing manner, yielding considerably improved generalization ability to ""unseen"" dataset. More importantly, the two-pathway framework makes it possible to combine both labeled and unlabeled data for self-supervised learning, which further enriches the embedding space for realistic generations.

" However, many interactive tasks cannot be completed using static visualizations. As datasets grow in size and complexity, static visualizations start losing their analytic and expressive power for interactive data exploration. Despite this limitation of static visualizations, there are still many cases where visualizations are limited to being static (e.g., visualizations on presentation slides or posters). We believe in many of these cases, static visualizations will benefit from allowing users to perform interactive tasks on them. Inspired by the introduction of numerous commercial personal augmented reality (AR) devices, we propose an AR solution that allows interactive data exploration of datasets on static visualizations. In particular, we present a prototype system named VisAR that uses the Microsoft Hololens to enable users to complete interactive tasks on static visualizations.","Static visualizations have analytic and expressive value, and their efficacy in elucidating complex datasets is well-documented in the literature.

Our methodology includes user studies that evaluate the effectiveness of static visualizations in terms of speed and accuracy of data interpretation. The results indicate that with thoughtful design, static visualizations not only serve as reliable tools for data exploration but also enhance the viewer's ability to discern patterns and derive meaningful conclusions from complex datasets.",no

" By a theorem of McNaughton and Papert, these are also the first-order definable languages. The dot-depth rose to prominence following the work of Thomas, who proved an exact correspondence with the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic: each level in the dot-depth hierarchy consists of all languages that can be defined with a prescribed number of quantifier blocks. One of the most famous open problems in automata theory is to settle whether the membership problem is decidable for each level: is it possible to decide whether an input regular language belongs to this level? Despite a significant research effort, membership by itself has only been solved for low levels. A recent breakthrough was achieved by replacing membership with a more general problem: separation . Given two input languages, one has to decide whether there exists a third language in the investigated level containing the first language and disjoint from the second. The motivation for looking at separation is threefold: (1) while more difficult, it is more rewarding, as solving it requires a better understanding; (2) being more general, it provides a more convenient framework, and (3) all recent membership algorithms are actually reductions to separation for lower levels. We present a separation algorithm for dot-depth two. A key point is that while dot-depth two is our most prominent application, our theorem is more general. We consider a family of hierarchies, which includes the dot-depth: concatenation hierarchies. They are built through a generic construction process: one first chooses an initial class, the basis, which serves as the lowest level in the hierarchy. Then, further levels are built by applying generic operations. Our main theorem states that for any concatenation hierarchy whose basis consists of finitely many languages, separation is decidable for level one. In the special case of the dot-depth, this can be lifted to level two using previously known results.","

The dot-depth hierarchy of Brzozowski and Cohen serves as a framework for analyzing the properties of star-free languages of finite words.

Our methods outperform other approaches, particularly in the task of detecting very popular or unpopular memes.","Our study aims to analyze the factors that contribute to the success of memes in social networks, focusing on the early spreading patterns. Through a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of successful memes and their early propagation, we aim to develop a predictive model that can identify the potential success of memes based on their initial spread within social networks.

"We analyze the performance of TCP and TCP with network coding (TCPNC) in lossy networks. We build upon the framework introduced by Padhye et al. and characterize the throughput behavior of classical TCP and TCPNC as a function of erasure probability, round-trip time, maximum window size, and duration of the connection. Our analytical results show that network coding masks random erasures from TCP, thus preventing TCP's performance degradation in lossy networks. It is further seen that TCPNC has significant throughput gains over TCP. In addition, we show that TCPNC may lead to cost reduction for wireless network providers while maintaining a certain quality of service to their users. We measure the cost in terms of number of base stations, which is highly correlated to the energy, capital, and operational costs of a network provider. We show that increasing the available bandwidth may not necessarily lead to increase in throughput, particularly in lossy networks in which TCP does not perform well. We show that using protocols such as TCPNC, which are more resilient to erasures, may lead to a throughput commensurate the bandwidth dedicated to each user.","Our study investigates the efficacy of TCP as well as TCP with network coding (TCPNC) within networks experiencing data loss. We build on the foundational work by Padhye et al. to describe how the throughput of traditional TCP and TCPNC correlates with factors such as loss likelihood, round-trip timing, the maximum size of the data window, and the length of the connection. The analytical findings indicate that network coding conceals random data loss from TCP, thereby safeguarding the protocol from performance drops in unreliable networks. Moreover, TCPNC demonstrates a considerable advantage in throughput compared to standard TCP. Additionally, our results suggest that TCPNC could lead to savings for wireless network providers, while still delivering a reliable level of service to customers. We assess cost through the number of base stations, which closely relates to the energy, capital, and operational expenses of network providers. We demonstrate that merely increasing bandwidth does not guarantee a boost in throughput, especially in lossy networks where TCP struggles. Instead, the deployment of protocols like TCPNC, which are better at handling data loss, can achieve throughput that is proportional to the bandwidth allocated to each user.",yes

" Indeed, the vast literature on computational epidemiology offers solid grounds for analytical studies and the definition of novel models aimed at both predictive and prescriptive scenario descriptions. To ease the access to diffusion modeling, several programming libraries and tools have been proposed during the last decade: however, to the best of our knowledge, none of them is explicitly designed to allow its users to integrate public interventions in their model. In this work, we introduce UTLDR, a framework that can simulate the effects of several public interventions (and their combinations) on the unfolding of epidemic processes. UTLDR enables the design of compartmental models incrementally and to simulate them over complex interaction network topologies. Moreover, it allows integrating external information on the analyzed population (e.g., age, gender, geographical allocation, and mobility patterns...) and to use it to stratify and refine the designed model. After introducing the framework, we provide a few case studies to underline its flexibility and expressive power.","

Moreover, the unfolding of epidemics has been increasingly studied through the lens of programming languages, specifically in the context of diffusion modeling. The use of programming languages has enabled researchers to model the spread of diseases in a more accurate and efficient manner, allowing for the exploration of various scenarios and the analysis of different factors influencing the diffusion process. Notably, the employed programming languages have been found to significantly impact the accuracy and computational efficiency of the simulations, highlighting the importance of selecting the appropriate language for the task at hand. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary nature of epidemic modeling has led to the development of new techniques and tools, such as combinations of numerical methods and statistical analysis, to better understand and predict the unfolding of epidemics.

" Such problems have applications, e.g., in computational biology. We provide a number of new and improved bounds for exact string reconstruction for settings where either the string or the queries are ""mixed-up."" For example, we show that a periodic (i.e., ""mixed-up string, S p k p , of smallest period p , where p p , can be reconstructed using O ( p lg n) substring queries, where is the alphabet size, if n S is unknown. We also show that we can reconstruct S after having been corrupted by a small number of errors d , measured by Hamming distance. In this case, we give an algorithm that uses O ( d p d p lg n d 1) queries. In addition, we show that a periodic string can be reconstructed using 2 lg n 2 p lg subsequence queries, and that general strings can be reconstructed using 2 lg n n lg subsequence queries, without knowledge of n in advance. This latter result improves the previous best, decades-old result, by Skiena and Sundaram. Finally, we believe we are the first to study the exact-learning query complexity for string reconstruction using jumbled-index queries, which are a ""mixed-up"" type of query that have received much attention of late.","In this paper, we extend upon previous research in the field of string reconstruction, analyzing the query complexity requirements for adaptive query models. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for understanding the relationship between query types and the efficiency of reconstruction. Our key contributions include establishing lower and upper bounds for the number of queries necessary to reconstruct strings of varying lengths and complexity with three query models: substring, subsequence, and jumbled-index queries. Using combinatorial arguments, we demonstrate that the complexity of reconstruction can vary significantly between query models. For substring queries, we show that the query complexity is linear with respect to the length of the string under certain conditions, while under different constraints, the complexity may increase. For subsequence queries, we discuss how the structure of the string affects the number of queries, with particular emphasis on the role of repeating patterns and unique elements within the string. Moreover, we explore the jumbled-index query model, a less conventional approach, and prove that the problem of reconstructing strings via j",no

(ii) Spectral initialization has marginal impact on the performance of the algorithm. The sharp analyses in this paper, not only enable us to compare the performance of our method with other phase recovery schemes, but also shed light on designing better iterative algorithms for other non-convex optimization problems.","In this study, we further develop the theoretical framework for the L2-regularized non-convex optimization problem by introducing a novel algorithm designed to recover signals from noisy phaseless observations with improved robustness and convergence properties.

In the era of a massive number of connected things and objects with a high grow rate, several challenges have been raised such as management, aggregation and storage for big produced data. In order to tackle some of these issues, cloud computing emerged to IoT as Cloud of Things (CoT) which provides virtually unlimited cloud services to enhance the large scale IoT platforms.

" We create a human baseline over the KAIST dataset and reveal that there is still a large gap between current top detectors and human performance. To narrow this gap, we propose a network fusion architecture, which consists of a multispectral proposal network to generate pedestrian proposals, and a subsequent multispectral classification network to distinguish pedestrian instances from hard negatives. The unified network is learned by jointly optimizing pedestrian detection and semantic segmentation tasks. The final detections are obtained by integrating the outputs from different modalities as well as the two stages. The approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the KAIST dataset while remain fast. Additionally, we contribute a sanitized version of training annotations for the KAIST dataset, and examine the effects caused by different kinds of annotation errors. Future research of this problem will benefit from the sanitized version which eliminates the interference of annotation errors.","In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multispectral pedestrian detection that leverages the complementary advantages of thermal infrared and visible light spectra to perform reliable detection in a variety of lighting conditions.

" Indeed, the well-known SOBS method and its variants based on neural networks were the leader methods on the large-scale CDnet 2012 dataset during a long time. Recently, convolutional neural networks which belong to deep learning methods were employed with success for background initialization, foreground detection and deep learned features. Currently, the top current background subtraction methods in CDnet 2014 are based on deep neural networks with a large gap of performance in comparison on the conventional unsupervised approaches based on multi-features or multi-cues strategies. Furthermore, a huge amount of papers was published since 2016 when Braham and Van Droogenbroeck published their first work on CNN applied to background subtraction providing a regular gain of performance. In this context, we provide the first review of deep neural network concepts in background subtraction for novices and experts in order to analyze this success and to provide further directions. For this, we first surveyed the methods used background initialization, background subtraction and deep learned features. Then, we discuss the adequacy of deep neural networks for background subtraction. Finally, experimental results are presented on the CDnet 2014 dataset.","

However, when dealing with videos acquired by moving cameras or drones, the background subtraction task becomes much more challenging.

" A seller has infinite copies of n products represented by nodes in a graph. There are m consumers, each has a budget and wants to buy two products. Consumers are represented by weighted edges. Given the prices of products, each consumer will buy both products she wants, at the given price, if she can afford to. Our objective is to help the seller price the products to maximize her profit. This problem is called graph vertex pricing (GVP) problem and has resisted several recent attempts despite its current simple solution. This motivates the study of this problem on special classes of graphs. In this paper, we study this problem on a large class of graphs such as graphs with bounded treewidth, bounded genus and k -partite graphs. We show that there exists an FPTAS for GVP on graphs with bounded treewidth. This result is also extended to an FPTAS for the more general single-minded pricing problem. On bounded genus graphs we present a PTAS and show that GVP is NP -hard even on planar graphs. We study the Sherali-Adams hierarchy applied to a natural Integer Program formulation that ( 1 ) -approximates the optimal solution of GVP . Sherali-Adams hierarchy has gained much interest recently as a possible approach to develop new approximation algorithms. We show that, when the input graph has bounded treewidth or bounded genus, applying a constant number of rounds of Sherali-Adams hierarchy makes the integrality gap of this natural LP arbitrarily small, thus giving a ( 1 ) -approximate solution to the original GVP instance. On k -partite graphs, we present a constant-factor approximation algorithm. We further improve the approximation factors for paths, cycles and graphs with degree at most three.","In this study, we address the issue of efficiently processing large class graphs.

"Histopathology tissue analysis is considered the gold standard in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Whole slide imaging, i.e., the scanning and digitization of entire histology slides, are now being adopted across the world in pathology labs. Trained histopathologists can provide an accurate diagnosis of biopsy specimens based on whole slide images (WSI). However, given the large size of these images and the increase in the number of potential cancer cases, an automated solution as an aid to histopathologists is highly desirable. In the recent past, deep learning-based techniques, namely, CNNs, have provided state of the art results in a wide variety of image analysis tasks, including analysis of digitized slides. However, the size of images and variability in histopathology tasks makes it a challenge to develop an integrated framework for histopathology image analysis. We propose a deep learning-based framework for histopathology tissue analysis. We demonstrate the generalizability of our framework, including training and inference, on several open-source datasets, which include CAMELYON (breast cancer metastases), DigestPath (colon cancer), and PAIP (liver cancer) datasets. Our segmentation pipeline is an ensemble of DenseNet-121, Inception-ResNet-V2, and DeeplabV3Plus, where all the networks for each task were trained end to end.

Furthermore, we highlight the challenges and limitations of these methods and outline future research directions in this field. Our findings suggest that the integration of computational methods with traditional histopathology tissue analysis may significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and prognosis, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.",no

"This paper deals with a complete bipartite matching problem with the objective of finding an optimal matching that maximizes a certain generic predefined utility function on the set of all matchings. After proving the NP-hardness of the problem using reduction from the 3-SAT problem, we propose a randomized algorithm based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique for solving this. We sample from Gibb's distribution and construct a reversible positive recurrent discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) that has the steady state distribution same as the Gibb's distribution. In one of our key contributions, we show that the constructed chain is 'rapid mixing', i.e. the convergence time to reach within a specified distance to the desired distribution is polynomial in the problem size. The rapid mixing property is established by obtaining a lower bound on the conductance of the DTMC graph and this result is of independent interest.","This paper deals with a complete bipartite matching problem with the objective of finding an optimal matching that maximizes a certain generic predefined utility function on the set of all matchings.

"Massive MIMO is seen as a main enabler for low-latency communications, thanks to its high spatial degrees of freedom. The channel hardening and favorable propagation properties of Massive MIMO are particularly important for multiplexing several URLLC devices. However, the actual utility of channel hardening and spatial multiplexing is dependent critically on the accuracy of channel knowledge. When several low-latency devices are multiplexed, the cost for acquiring accurate knowledge becomes critical, and it is not evident how many devices can be served with a latency-reliability requirement and how many pilot symbols should be allocated. This paper investigates the trade-off between achieving high spectral efficiency and high reliability in the downlink, by employing various power allocation strategies, for maximum ratio and minimum mean square error precoders. The results show that using max-min SINR power allocation achieves the best reliability, at the expense of lower sum spectral efficiency.","Massive MIMO technology enhances low-latency communications with its spatial properties, but the benefit depends on precise channel knowledge, posing challenges for multiplexing low-latency devices.

"Cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has become the gold standard for the non-invasive evaluation of cardiac function. In particular, it allows the accurate quantification of functional parameters including the chamber volumes and ejection fraction. Deep learning has shown the potential to automate the requisite cardiac structure segmentation. However, the lack of robustness of deep learning models has hindered their widespread clinical adoption. Due to differences in the data characteristics, neural networks trained on data from a specific scanner are not guaranteed to generalise well to data acquired at a different centre or with a different scanner.

This approach is evaluated on both seen and unseen domains from the MMs challenge dataset and the domain-adversarial approach shows improved performance as compared to standard training.

"Multi-target multi-camera tracking (MTMCT) systems track targets across cameras. Due to the continuity of target trajectories, tracking systems usually restrict their data association within a local neighborhood. In single camera tracking, local neighborhood refers to consecutive frames; in multi-camera tracking, it refers to neighboring cameras that the target may appear successively. For similarity estimation, tracking systems often adopt appearance features learned from the re-identification (re-ID) perspective. Different from tracking, re-ID usually does not have access to the trajectory cues that can limit the search space to a local neighborhood. Due to its global matching property, the re-ID perspective requires to learn global appearance features. We argue that the mismatch between the local matching procedure in tracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may compromise MTMCT performance. To fit the local matching procedure in MTMCT, in this work, we introduce locality aware appearance metric (LAAM). Specifically, we design an intra-camera metric for single camera tracking, and an inter-camera metric for multi-camera tracking. Both metrics are trained with data pairs sampled from their corresponding local neighborhoods, as opposed to global sampling in the re-ID perspective. We show that the locally learned metrics can be successfully applied on top of several globally learned re-ID features. With the proposed method, we report new state-of-the-art performance on the DukeMTMC dataset, and a substantial improvement on the CityFlow dataset.","Multi-target multi-camera tracking (MTMCT) systems are designed to monitor targets as they move through different camera views. These systems typically confine their data association to a local vicinity due to the connectedness of the target paths. In single camera setups, 'local neighborhood' refers to sequential snapshots, while in multi-camera settings, it pertains to adjacent cameras where the target might consecutively appear. For gauging similarity, these tracking systems often utilize appearance features that are honed from a re-identification (re-ID) standpoint. Contrary to tracking, re-ID often lacks trajectory hints, which help narrow down the search to a neighboring region. Given the global matching requirements of re-ID, learning widespread appearance features becomes necessary. However, we suggest that this disparityâ€”local tracking approaches using globally oriented re-ID appearance featuresâ€”could degrade MTMCT efficiency. To align with the local nature of MTMCT, we present a locality aware appearance metric (LAAM) in our research. We tailor an intra-camera metric for tracking within a single camera and an inter-camera metric for tracking across multiple cameras. Both metrics are refined using data pairings drawn from their respective nearby areas, distinct from the broad sampling used in re-ID. Our findings demonstrate that these locally informed metrics can enhance a variety of globally informed re-ID features when applied. Employing our technique, we've achieved unprecedented performance on the DukeMTMC dataset and notable advancements on the CityFlow dataset.",yes

"The theory of isospectral flows comprises a large class of continuous dynamical systems, particularly integrable systems and Lie-Poisson systems. Their discretization is a classical problem in numerical analysis. Preserving the spectra in the discrete flow requires the conservation of high order polynomials, which is hard to come by. Existing methods achieving this are complicated and usually fail to preserve the underlying Lie-Poisson structure. Here we present a class of numerical methods of arbitrary order for Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian isospectral flows, which preserve both the spectra and the Lie-Poisson structure. The methods are surprisingly simple, and avoid the use of constraints or exponential maps. Furthermore, due to preservation of the Lie-Poisson structure, they exhibit near conservation of the Hamiltonian function. As an illustration, we apply the methods to several classical isospectral flows.

Common methods that intend to do this are often complex and do not successfully retain the inherent Lie-Poisson framework.

" Many algorithms try to predict model performance of the pruned sub-nets by introducing various evaluation methods. But they are either inaccurate or very complicated for general application. In this work, we present a pruning method called EagleEye, in which a simple yet efficient evaluation component based on adaptive batch normalization is applied to unveil a strong correlation between different pruned DNN structures and their final settled accuracy. This strong correlation allows us to fast spot the pruned candidates with highest potential accuracy without actually fine-tuning them. This module is also general to plug-in and improve some existing pruning algorithms. EagleEye achieves better pruning performance than all of the studied pruning algorithms in our experiments. Concretely, to prune MobileNet V1 and ResNet-50, EagleEye outperforms all compared methods by up to 3.8. Even in the more challenging experiments of pruning the compact model of MobileNet V1, EagleEye achieves the highest accuracy of 70.9 with an overall 50 operations (FLOPs) pruned. All accuracy results are Top-1 ImageNet classification accuracy.

"Multispectral pedestrian detection has attracted increasing attention from the research community due to its crucial competence for many around-the-clock applications (e.g., video surveillance and autonomous driving), especially under insufficient illumination conditions. We create a human baseline over the KAIST dataset and reveal that there is still a large gap between current top detectors and human performance. To narrow this gap, we propose a network fusion architecture, which consists of a multispectral proposal network to generate pedestrian proposals, and a subsequent multispectral classification network to distinguish pedestrian instances from hard negatives. The unified network is learned by jointly optimizing pedestrian detection and semantic segmentation tasks. The final detections are obtained by integrating the outputs from different modalities as well as the two stages.

" Inspired by the topical correspondence between mathematical equations and word contexts observed in scientific texts, we propose a novel topic model that jointly generates mathematical equations and their surrounding text (TopicEq). Using an extension of the correlated topic model, the context is generated from a mixture of latent topics, and the equation is generated by an RNN that depends on the latent topic activations. To experiment with this model, we create a corpus of 400K equation-context pairs extracted from a range of scientific articles from arXiv, and fit the model using a variational autoencoder approach. Experimental results show that this joint model significantly outperforms existing topic models and equation models for scientific texts. Moreover, we qualitatively show that the model effectively captures the relationship between topics and mathematics, enabling novel applications such as topic-aware equation generation, equation topic inference, and topic-aware alignment of mathematical symbols and words."," This duality of communication is essential for the accurate representation of scientific concepts, as mathematical expressions can convey nuanced and complex information, while text provides context and interpretation.

" A seller has infinite copies of n products represented by nodes in a graph. There are m consumers, each has a budget and wants to buy two products. Consumers are represented by weighted edges. Given the prices of products, each consumer will buy both products she wants, at the given price, if she can afford to. Our objective is to help the seller price the products to maximize her profit. This problem is called graph vertex pricing (GVP) problem and has resisted several recent attempts despite its current simple solution. This motivates the study of this problem on special classes of graphs. In this paper, we study this problem on a large class of graphs such as graphs with bounded treewidth, bounded genus and k -partite graphs. We show that there exists an FPTAS for GVP on graphs with bounded treewidth. This result is also extended to an FPTAS for the more general single-minded pricing problem. On bounded genus graphs we present a PTAS and show that GVP is NP -hard even on planar graphs. We study the Sherali-Adams hierarchy applied to a natural Integer Program formulation that ( 1 ) -approximates the optimal solution of GVP . Sherali-Adams hierarchy has gained much interest recently as a possible approach to develop new approximation algorithms. We show that, when the input graph has bounded treewidth or bounded genus, applying a constant number of rounds of Sherali-Adams hierarchy makes the integrality gap of this natural LP arbitrarily small, thus giving a ( 1 ) -approximate solution to the original GVP instance. On k -partite graphs, we present a constant-factor approximation algorithm. We further improve the approximation factors for paths, cycles and graphs with degree at most three.","

For large class graphs, the problem of efficiently processing graph data is a significant challenge.

Our approach is based on a careful analysis of the graph structure and the properties of the nodes that represent consumers, allowing us to develop a scalable and effective method for processing these graphs.

" Nevertheless, their data conflict management is still sequential in essential when some vertex needs a large number of conflicting updates at the same time, leading to prohibitive performance degradation. This is particularly true for processing natural graphs. In this paper, we have the insight that the atomic operations for the vertex updating of many graph algorithms (e.g., BFS, PageRank and WCC) are typically incremental and simplex. This hence allows us to parallelize the conflicting vertex updates in an accumulative manner. We architect a novel graph-specific accelerator that can simultaneously process atomic vertex updates for massive parallelism on the conflicting data access while ensuring the correctness. A parallel accumulator is designed to remove the serialization in atomic protection for conflicting vertex updates through merging their results in parallel. Our implementation on Xilinx Virtex UltraScale XCVU9P with a wide variety of typical graph algorithms shows that our accelerator achieves an average throughput by 2.36 GTEPS as well as up to 3.14x performance speedup in comparison with state-of-the-art ForeGraph (with single-chip version).","In this study, we extend the burgeoning field of graph-specific computing by introducing a novel architecture for a graph processing accelerator (GPA) that leverages the inherent parallelism in graph algorithms.

" It demands the distribution of the predicted output to be independent of the sensitive attribute. We consider the case that the sensitive attribute is available for prediction. We establish a connection between fair regression and optimal transport theory, based on which we derive a close form expression for the optimal fair predictor. Specifically, we show that the distribution of this optimum is the Wasserstein barycenter of the distributions induced by the standard regression function on the sensitive groups. This result offers an intuitive interpretation of the optimal fair prediction and suggests a simple post-processing algorithm to achieve fairness. We establish risk and distribution-free fairness guarantees for this procedure. Numerical experiments indicate that our method is very effective in learning fair models, with a relative increase in error rate that is inferior to the relative gain in fairness.","In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework designed to learn real-valued functions while adhering to the Demographic Parity constraint, which requires that the predictive distribution of outcomes be independent of any specified sensitive attributes. Our methodology balances the trade-off between accuracy and fairness by integrating a demographic parity regularizer into the loss function. We formally define demographic parity for real-valued functions and introduce a regularization term that quantifies the deviation from this fairness constraint. The regularizer is adaptable to various machine learning models, including linear regression, support vector regression, and neural networks. Utilizing synthetic and real-world datasets, we empirically evaluate the performance of our proposed solution. We benchmark it against state-of-the-art fairness-aware learning algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving demographic parity while maintaining competitive accuracy.

"Outcomes with a natural order commonly occur in prediction tasks and oftentimes the available input data are a mixture of complex data, like images, and tabular predictors. Although deep Learning (DL) methods have shown outstanding performance on image classification, most models treat ordered outcomes as unordered and lack interpretability. In contrast, classical ordinal regression models yield interpretable predictor effects but are limited to tabular input data. Here, we present the highly modular class of ordinal neural network transformation models (ontram s). Transformation models use a parametric transformation function and a simple distribution to trade off flexibility and interpretability of individual model components. In ontram s, this trade-off is achieved by additively decomposing the transformation function into terms for the tabular and image data using a set of jointly trained neural networks. We show that the most flexible ontram s achieve on-par performance with DL classifiers while outperforming them in training speed. We discuss how to interpret components of ontram s in general and in the case of correlated tabular and image data. Taken together, ontram s join benefits of DL and distributional regression to create interpretable prediction models for ordinal outcomes.","In prediction tasks, outcomes with a natural order are often present and the input data can be a combination of complex data, such as images, and tabular predictors.

" We propose a novel transaction type, which enables privacy preserving trading of independent assets on a common block-chain. This is achieved by extending the ring confidential transaction with an additional commitment to a colour and a publicly verifiable proof of conservation. With our coloured confidential ring signatures, new token types can be introduced and transferred by any participant using the same sized anonymity set as single-token privacy aware block-chains. Thereby, our system facilitates tracking assets on an immutable ledger without compromising the confidentiality of transactions.","

This trade-off has led to a growing interest in developing novel privacy-preserving techniques that can effectively address the privacy concerns of block-chain users without compromising the ledger's integrity. One such approach is the use of zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption, which enable the verification of transactions without revealing their underlying data.

"Massive MIMO is seen as a main enabler for low-latency communications, thanks to its high spatial degrees of freedom. The channel hardening and favorable propagation properties of Massive MIMO are particularly important for multiplexing several URLLC devices. However, the actual utility of channel hardening and spatial multiplexing is dependent critically on the accuracy of channel knowledge. When several low-latency devices are multiplexed, the cost for acquiring accurate knowledge becomes critical, and it is not evident how many devices can be served with a latency-reliability requirement and how many pilot symbols should be allocated. This paper investigates the trade-off between achieving high spectral efficiency and high reliability in the downlink, by employing various power allocation strategies, for maximum ratio and minimum mean square error precoders.

" Quantum systems are subsystems of classical statistical systems. The Ising spins can represent macroscopic two-level observables, and the quantum subsystem employs suitable expectation values and correlations. We discuss static memory materials based on Ising spins for which boundary information can be transported through the bulk in a generalized equilibrium state. They can realize quantum operations as the Hadamard or CNOT-gate for the quantum subsystem. Classical probabilistic systems can account for the entanglement of quantum spins. An arbitrary unitary evolution for an arbitrary number of quantum spins can be described by static memory materials for an infinite number of Ising spins which may, in turn, correspond to continuous variables or fields. We discuss discrete subsets of unitary operations realized by a finite number of Ising spins. They may be useful for new computational structures. We suggest that features of quantum computation or more general probabilistic computation may be realized by neural networks, neuromorphic computing or perhaps even the brain. This does neither require small isolated entities nor very low temperature. In these systems the processing of probabilistic information can be more general than for static memory materials. We propose a general formalism for probabilistic computing for which deterministic computing and quantum computing are special limiting cases.","The bit-quantum map is a mathematical framework that provides a relationship between probabilistic information associated with Ising spins or classical bits and their corresponding quantum spins or qubits.

"Fourier phase retrieval is a classical problem that deals with the recovery of an image from the amplitude measurements of its Fourier coefficients. Conventional methods solve this problem via iterative (alternating) minimization by leveraging some prior knowledge about the structure of the unknown image. The inherent ambiguities about shift and flip in the Fourier measurements make this problem especially difficult; and most of the existing methods use several random restarts with different permutations. In this paper, we assume that a known (learned) reference is added to the signal before capturing the Fourier amplitude measurements. Our method is inspired by the principle of adding a reference signal in holography. To recover the signal, we implement an iterative phase retrieval method as an unrolled network. Then we use back propagation to learn the reference that provides us the best reconstruction for a fixed number of phase retrieval iterations. We performed a number of simulations on a variety of datasets under different conditions and found that our proposed method for phase retrieval via unrolled network and learned reference provides near-perfect recovery at fixed (small) computational cost.

"Current object detection frameworks mainly rely on bounding box regression to localize objects. Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, the precision of bounding box regression remains unsatisfactory, hence limiting performance in object detection. We observe that precise localization requires careful placement of each side of the bounding box. However, the mainstream approach, which focuses on predicting centers and sizes, is not the most effective way to accomplish this task, especially when there exists displacements with large variance between the anchors and the targets. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, named as Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL), where each side of the bounding box is respectively localized with a dedicated network branch. Moreover, to tackle the difficulty of precise localization in the presence of displacements with large variance, we further propose a two-step localization scheme, which first predicts a range of movement through bucket prediction and then pinpoints the precise position within the predicted bucket. We test the proposed method on both two-stage and single-stage detection frameworks.

"Recently, deep learning has been proposed as a potential technique for improving the physical layer performance of radio receivers. Despite the large amount of encouraging results, most works have not considered spatial multiplexing in the context of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) receivers. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based MIMO receiver architecture that consists of a ResNet-based convolutional neural network, also known as DeepRx, combined with a so-called transformation layer, all trained together. We propose two novel alternatives for the transformation layer: a maximal ratio combining-based transformation, or a fully learned transformation. The former relies more on expert knowledge, while the latter utilizes learned multiplicative layers. Both proposed transformation layers are shown to clearly outperform the conventional baseline receiver, especially with sparse pilot configurations. To the best of our knowledge, these are some of the first results showing such high performance for a fully learned MIMO receiver.","Deep learning has been proposed for improving the physical layer performance of radio receivers, with a focus on MIMO receivers.

"Objects and actors are communicating state machines, offering and consuming different services at different points in their lifecycle. Two complementary challenges arise when programming such systems. When objects interact, their state machines must be ""compatible,"" so that services are requested only when they are available. Dually, when objects refine other objects, their state machines must be ""compliant,"" so that services are honoured whenever they are promised. In this paper we show how the idea of multiparty compatibility from the session types literature can be applied to both of these problems. We present an untyped language in which concurrent objects are checked automatically for compatibility and compliance. For simple objects, checking can be exhaustive and has the feel of a type system. More complex objects can be partially validated via test cases, leading to a methodology closer to continuous testing. Our proof-of-concept implementation is limited in some important respects, but demonstrates the potential value of the approach and the relationship to existing software development practices.","Objects and actors communicate state machines and offer and consume different services, presenting challenges in programming systems to ensure compatibility and compliance.

We evaluate naturalness and speaker similarity of the converted whisper on an internal corpus and on the publicly available wTIMIT corpus.

" We create a human baseline over the KAIST dataset and reveal that there is still a large gap between current top detectors and human performance. To narrow this gap, we propose a network fusion architecture, which consists of a multispectral proposal network to generate pedestrian proposals, and a subsequent multispectral classification network to distinguish pedestrian instances from hard negatives. The unified network is learned by jointly optimizing pedestrian detection and semantic segmentation tasks. The final detections are obtained by integrating the outputs from different modalities as well as the two stages. The approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the KAIST dataset while remain fast.

"This work presents ensemble forecasting of monthly electricity demand using pattern similarity-based forecasting methods (PSFMs). PSFMs applied in this study include k -nearest neighbor model, fuzzy neighborhood model, kernel regression model, and general regression neural network. An integral part of PSFMs is a time series representation using patterns of time series sequences. Pattern representation ensures the input and output data unification through filtering a trend and equalizing variance. Two types of ensembles are created: heterogeneous and homogeneous. The former consists of different type base models, while the latter consists of a single-type base model. Five strategies are used for controlling a diversity of members in a homogeneous approach. The diversity is generated using different subsets of training data, different subsets of features, randomly disrupted input and output variables, and randomly disrupted model parameters.

"We study the query complexity of exactly reconstructing a string from adaptive queries, such as substring, subsequence, and jumbled-index queries. Such problems have applications, e.g., in computational biology. We provide a number of new and improved bounds for exact string reconstruction for settings where either the string or the queries are ""mixed-up."" For example, we show that a periodic (i.e., ""mixed-up string, S p k p , of smallest period p , where p p , can be reconstructed using O ( p lg n) substring queries, where is the alphabet size, if n S is unknown. We also show that we can reconstruct S after having been corrupted by a small number of errors d , measured by Hamming distance.

"We present a method of backward induction for computing approximate subgame perfect Nash equilibria of infinitely repeated games with discounted payoffs. This uses the selection monad transformer, combined with the searchable set monad viewed as a notion of 'topologically compact' nondeterminism, and a simple model of computable real numbers. This is the first application of Escardo and Oliva's theory of higher-order sequential games to games of imperfect information, in which (as well as its mathematical elegance) lazy evaluation does nontrivial work for us compared with a traditional game-theoretic analysis. Since a full theoretical understanding of this method is lacking (and appears to be very hard), we consider this an 'experimental' paper heavily inspired by theoretical ideas. We use the famous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma as a worked example.","A new method for computing approximate subgame perfect Nash equilibria of infinitely repeated games with discounted payoffs is presented, using backward induction, the selection monad transformer, and a model of computable real numbers, with its first application to games of imperfect information, inspired by theoretical ideas.",yes
"A profile matching algorithm takes as input a user profile of one social network and returns, if existing, the profile of the same person in another social network. Such methods have immediate applications in Internet marketing, search, security, and a number of other domains, which is why this topic saw a recent surge in popularity. In this paper, we present a user identity resolution approach that uses minimal supervision and achieves a precision of 0.98 at a recall of 0.54. Furthermore, the method is computationally efficient and easily parallelizable. We show that the method can be used to match Facebook, the most popular social network globally, with VKontakte, the most popular social network among Russian-speaking users.","

The proposed algorithm leverages state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning and natural language processing to achieve a high accuracy in profile matching. Specifically, the algorithm employs a combination of feature extraction and similarity measurement methods to compare user profiles across different social networks. The feature extraction methods include the use of keyword extraction, entity recognition, and sentiment analysis to capture the semantic meaning of user profiles. The similarity measurement methods include cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the similarity between user profiles.

"The Count-Min sketch is an important and well-studied data summarization method. It allows one to estimate the count of any item in a stream using a small, fixed size data sketch. However, the accuracy of the sketch depends on characteristics of the underlying data. This has led to a number of count estimation procedures which work well in one scenario but perform poorly in others. A practitioner is faced with two basic, unanswered questions. Which variant should be chosen when the data is unknown? Given an estimate, is its error sufficiently small to be trustworthy? We provide answers to these questions. We derive new count estimators, including a provably optimal estimator, which best or match previous estimators in all scenarios. We also provide practical, tight error bounds at query time for both new and existing estimators. These error estimates also yield procedures to choose the sketch tuning parameters optimally, as they can extrapolate the error to different choices of sketch width and depth. The key observation is that the distribution of errors in each counter can be empirically estimated from the sketch itself. By first estimating this distribution, count estimation becomes a statistical estimation and inference problem with a known error distribution. This provides both a principled way to derive new and optimal estimators as well as a way to study the error and properties of existing estimators.","The Count-Min sketch is a well-researched method for summarizing data.

"The scientific method drives improvements in public health, but a strategy of obstructionism has impeded scientists from gathering even a minimal amount of information to address America's gun violence epidemic. We argue that in spite of a lack of federal investment, large amounts of publicly available data offer scientists an opportunity to measure a range of firearm-related behaviors. Given the diversity of available data - including news coverage, social media, web forums, online advertisements, and Internet searches (to name a few) - there are ample opportunities for scientists to study everything from trends in particular types of gun violence to gun-related behaviors (such as purchases and safety practices) to public understanding of and sentiment towards various gun violence reduction measures. Science has been sidelined in the gun violence debate for too long. Scientists must tap the big media datastream and help resolve this crisis.","The pursuit of scientific inquiry advances public health, yet active efforts to block research have hindered scientists from collecting even the basic data necessary to tackle the gun violence crisis in the United States. Despite the absence of federal funding, there is an abundance of accessible public data that can enable scientists to analyze various firearm-related activities. The diversity of data sources available â€“ such as journalistic reports, social networks, online forums, digital advertising, and web searches, among others â€“ presents numerous chances for scientists to explore aspects ranging from gun violence tendencies to firearm-related actions (like buying habits and safety measures) to the public's perception and attitude towards initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence.

" Quantum systems are subsystems of classical statistical systems. The Ising spins can represent macroscopic two-level observables, and the quantum subsystem employs suitable expectation values and correlations. We discuss static memory materials based on Ising spins for which boundary information can be transported through the bulk in a generalized equilibrium state. They can realize quantum operations as the Hadamard or CNOT-gate for the quantum subsystem. Classical probabilistic systems can account for the entanglement of quantum spins. An arbitrary unitary evolution for an arbitrary number of quantum spins can be described by static memory materials for an infinite number of Ising spins which may, in turn, correspond to continuous variables or fields. We discuss discrete subsets of unitary operations realized by a finite number of Ising spins. They may be useful for new computational structures. We suggest that features of quantum computation or more general probabilistic computation may be realized by neural networks, neuromorphic computing or perhaps even the brain. This does neither require small isolated entities nor very low temperature. In these systems the processing of probabilistic information can be more general than for static memory materials. We propose a general formalism for probabilistic computing for which deterministic computing and quantum computing are special limiting cases.","In this study, we extend the foundational work on bit-quantum map dynamics by introducing a novel framework for understanding the transition of based Ising spins into the realm of quantum computation. Utilizing a comprehensive mathematical model, we represent the evolution of classical spin information into qubit states, thus bridging the gap between classical and quantum systems. Our approach leverages the intrinsic properties of Ising spins, characterized by their binary interaction potentials, to inform the probabilistic behavior of qubits. By applying the bit-quantum map, we are able to systematically address the complexities introduced by superposition and entanglement inherent to quantum mechanics. Through rigorous simulations and analytical methods, we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework in capturing the nuances of this transformation. Our results reveal that the alignment of based Ising spins can significantly influence the resultant quantum states, suggesting that the underlying classical configurations play a key role in determining the computational power and behavior of quantum systems derived from them.

"Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources.

"A non-iterative method for the construction of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) phase from the magnitude is presented. The method is based on the direct relationship between the partial derivatives of the phase and the logarithm of the magnitude of the un-sampled STFT with respect to the Gaussian window. Although the theory holds in the continuous setting only, the experiments show that the algorithm performs well even in the discretized setting (Discrete Gabor transform) with low redundancy using the sampled Gaussian window, the truncated Gaussian window and even other compactly supported windows like the Hann window. Due to the non-iterative nature, the algorithm is very fast and it is suitable for long audio signals.

"Multi-target multi-camera tracking (MTMCT) systems track targets across cameras. Due to the continuity of target trajectories, tracking systems usually restrict their data association within a local neighborhood. In single camera tracking, local neighborhood refers to consecutive frames; in multi-camera tracking, it refers to neighboring cameras that the target may appear successively. For similarity estimation, tracking systems often adopt appearance features learned from the re-identification (re-ID) perspective. Different from tracking, re-ID usually does not have access to the trajectory cues that can limit the search space to a local neighborhood. Due to its global matching property, the re-ID perspective requires to learn global appearance features. We argue that the mismatch between the local matching procedure in tracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may compromise MTMCT performance. To fit the local matching procedure in MTMCT, in this work, we introduce locality aware appearance metric (LAAM). Specifically, we design an intra-camera metric for single camera tracking, and an inter-camera metric for multi-camera tracking. Both metrics are trained with data pairs sampled from their corresponding local neighborhoods, as opposed to global sampling in the re-ID perspective. We show that the locally learned metrics can be successfully applied on top of several globally learned re-ID features. With the proposed method, we report new state-of-the-art performance on the DukeMTMC dataset, and a substantial improvement on the CityFlow dataset.","MTMCT systems are used to track targets across multiple cameras, and they typically limit their data association to a local neighborhood in order to ensure the continuity of target trajectories.

"Sparse matrices are favorable objects in machine learning and optimization. When such matrices are used, in place of dense ones, the overall complexity requirements in optimization can be significantly reduced in practice, both in terms of space and run-time.

"Microfluidic devices are utilized to control and direct flow behavior in a wide variety of applications, particularly in medical diagnostics. A particularly popular form of microfluidics - called inertial microfluidic flow sculpting - involves placing a sequence of pillars to controllably deform an initial flow field into a desired one. Inertial flow sculpting can be formally defined as an inverse problem, where one identifies a sequence of pillars (chosen, with replacement, from a finite set of pillars, each of which produce a specific transformation) whose composite transformation results in a user-defined desired transformation. Endemic to most such problems in engineering, inverse problems are usually quite computationally intractable, with most traditional approaches based on search and optimization strategies. In this paper, we pose this inverse problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. We train a DoubleDQN agent to learn from this environment. The results suggest that learning is possible using a DoubleDQN model with the success frequency reaching 90 in 200,000 episodes and the rewards converging. While most of the results are obtained by fixing a particular target flow shape to simplify the learning problem, we later demonstrate how to transfer the learning of an agent based on one target shape to another, i.e. from one design to another and thus be useful for a generic design of a flow shape.","Microfluidic devices are used in a variety of applications, particularly in medical diagnostics, with inertial flow sculpting being a popular form.

We propose two novel alternatives for the transformation layer: a maximal ratio combining-based transformation, or a fully learned transformation. The former relies more on expert knowledge, while the latter utilizes learned multiplicative layers. Both proposed transformation layers are shown to clearly outperform the conventional baseline receiver, especially with sparse pilot configurations.

"Future advances in deep learning and its impact on the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in all fields depends heavily on data size and computational power. Sacrificing massive computing resources in exchange for better precision rates of the network model is recognized by many researchers. This leads to huge computing consumption and satisfactory results are not always expected when computing resources are limited. Therefore, it is necessary to find a balance between resources and model performance to achieve satisfactory results. This article proposes a self-adaptive quality of experience (QoE) framework, DeepNetQoE, to guide the training of deep networks. A self-adaptive QoE model is set up that relates the model's accuracy with the computing resources required for training which will allow the experience value of the model to improve. To maximize the experience value when computer resources are limited, a resource allocation model and solutions need to be established. In addition, we carry out experiments based on four network models to analyze the experience values with respect to the crowd counting example. Experimental results show that the proposed DeepNetQoE is capable of adaptively obtaining a high experience value according to user needs and therefore guiding users to determine the computational resources allocated to the network models.","text: The article discusses the importance of finding a balance between computing resources and model performance in deep learning to achieve satisfactory results.

"This paper studies the stability and dynamic control of underlay mobile edge networks. First, the stability region for a multiuser edge network is obtained under the assumption of full channel state information. This result provides a benchmark figure for comparing performance of the proposed algorithms.

This algorithm is proven to converge to a utility point arbitrarily close to the maximum achievable utility within the stability region. Finally, more practical implementation issues such as distributed scheduling are examined by designing efficient scheduling algorithms taking advantage of communication diversity. The proposed distributed solutions utilize mini-slots for contention resolution and achieve a certain fraction of the utility optimal point.

"Despite recent progress on semantic segmentation, there still exist huge challenges in medical ultra-resolution image segmentation. The methods based on multi-branch structure can make a good balance between computational burdens and segmentation accuracy. However, the fusion structure in these methods require to be designed elaborately to achieve desirable result, which leads to model redundancy. In this paper, we propose Meta Segmentation Network (MSN) to solve this challenging problem. With the help of meta-learning, the fusion module of MSN is quite simple but effective. MSN can fast generate the weights of fusion layers through a simple meta-learner, requiring only a few training samples and epochs to converge. In addition, to avoid learning all branches from scratch, we further introduce a particular weight sharing mechanism to realize a fast knowledge adaptation and share the weights among multiple branches, resulting in the performance improvement and significant parameters reduction. The experimental results on two challenging ultra-resolution medical datasets BACH and ISIC show that MSN achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","While recent advancements have been made in semantic segmentation, substantial difficulties remain in segmenting medical images of ultra-high resolution.

The network quickly derives the weights for the fusion layers using a basic meta-learner, which achieves convergence with minimal training examples and epochs. To prevent the necessity of developing each branch from the ground up, we also incorporate a unique weight-sharing strategy.

" Most existing studies on product search focus on developing effective retrieval models that rank items by their likelihood to be purchased. They, however, ignore the problem that there is a gap between how systems and customers perceive the relevance of items. Without explanations, users may not understand why product search engines retrieve certain items for them, which consequentially leads to imperfect user experience and suboptimal system performance in practice. In this work, we tackle this problem by constructing explainable retrieval models for product search. Specifically, we propose to model the ""search and purchase"" behavior as a dynamic relation between users and items, and create a dynamic knowledge graph based on both the multi-relational product data and the context of the search session. Ranking is conducted based on the relationship between users and items in the latent space, and explanations are generated with logic inferences and entity soft matching on the knowledge graph. Empirical experiments show that our model, which we refer to as the Dynamic Relation Embedding Model (DREM), significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and has the ability to produce reasonable explanations for search results.","In this paper, we investigate the optimization of product search algorithms to enhance customer discovery experiences on e-commerce platforms.

" The plants are now able to be charged by a LED in just 10 seconds and last for several minutes. They use a specialized nanoparticle and an enzyme called luciferase to absorb light, store some of it, and emit it gradually. A type of light capacitor was created to make the plants glow longer. The glowing plants are able to photosynthesize without any interference from the nanoparticles.","

This breakthrough technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we light our homes and workplaces. The team at MIT has been working tirelessly to optimize the light-emitting plants, and their efforts are finally starting to pay off. In a recent experiment, the team was able to achieve a significant increase in the brightness of the plants, making them capable of illuminating a small room. The plans are to continue optimizing the technology until the plants are bright enough to light up an entire house or office building.",no
"This paper proposes a low-computational Bayesian algorithm for noisy sparse recovery (NSR), called BHT-BP. In this framework, we consider an LDPC-like measurement matrices which has a tree-structured property, and additive white Gaussian noise. BHT-BP has a joint detection-and-estimation structure consisting of a sparse support detector and a nonzero estimator. The support detector is designed under the criterion of the minimum detection error probability using a nonparametric belief propagation (nBP) and composite binary hypothesis tests. The nonzeros are estimated in the sense of linear MMSE, where the support detection result is utilized. BHT-BP has its strength in noise robust support detection, effectively removing quantization errors caused by the uniform sampling-based nBP. Therefore, in the NSR problems, BHT-BP has advantages over CS-BP which is an existing nBP algorithm, being comparable to other recent CS solvers, in several aspects. In addition, we examine impact of the minimum nonzero value of sparse signals via BHT-BP, on the basis of the results of , , . Our empirical result shows that variation of x m i n is reflected to recovery performance in the form of SNR shift.","The proposed BHT-BP (Bayesian Hypothesis Testing Belief Propagation) algorithm is designed to efficiently reconstruct sparse signals from noisy measurements. Building upon the Bayesian framework, the algorithm integrates hypothesis testing to discern the presence of non-zero signal components, thereby enhancing sparsity detection while maintaining computational simplicity. In this paper, we present a detailed formulation of the BHT-BP algorithm, followed by a rigorous theoretical analysis. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated through a series of experiments. Specifically, we examine the reconstruction accuracy, robustness to varying noise levels, and computational efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art NSR algorithms. Our results indicate that BHT-BP not only yields superior reconstruction quality in high noise regimes but also achieves this with a significantly reduced computational burden, making it amenable to applications with stringent computational constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of BHT-BP, showing that the method maintains its effectiveness as the problem size grows. We also explore the algorithm's sensitivity to",no
"We present methods to serialize and deserialize tree ensembles that optimize inference latency when models are not already loaded into memory. This arises whenever models are larger than memory, but also systematically when models are deployed on low-resource devices, such as in the Internet of Things, or run as Web micro-services where resources are allocated on demand. Our packed serialized trees (PACSET) encode reference locality in the layout of a tree ensemble using principles from external memory algorithms. The layout interleaves correlated nodes across multiple trees, uses leaf cardinality to collocate the nodes on the most popular paths and is optimized for the IO blocksize. The result is that each IO yields a higher fraction of useful data, leading to a 2-6 times reduction in classification latency for interactive workloads.","We have developed techniques for serializing and deserializing tree ensembles that optimize inference latency when models are not already stored in memory.

"A bit-quantum map relates probabilistic information for Ising spins or classical bits to quantum spins or qubits. Quantum systems are subsystems of classical statistical systems. The Ising spins can represent macroscopic two-level observables, and the quantum subsystem employs suitable expectation values and correlations. We discuss static memory materials based on Ising spins for which boundary information can be transported through the bulk in a generalized equilibrium state. They can realize quantum operations as the Hadamard or CNOT-gate for the quantum subsystem. Classical probabilistic systems can account for the entanglement of quantum spins. An arbitrary unitary evolution for an arbitrary number of quantum spins can be described by static memory materials for an infinite number of Ising spins which may, in turn, correspond to continuous variables or fields. We discuss discrete subsets of unitary operations realized by a finite number of Ising spins. They may be useful for new computational structures. We suggest that features of quantum computation or more general probabilistic computation may be realized by neural networks, neuromorphic computing or perhaps even the brain. This does neither require small isolated entities nor very low temperature. In these systems the processing of probabilistic information can be more general than for static memory materials.

"This paper presents the impact of using quantization on the efficiency of multi-class text classification in the training process of a support vector machine (SVM). This work is focused on comparing the efficiency of SVM model trained using reduced precision with its original form.

" In practice, however, it is common to carefully hand-design the reward function to encourage a particular solution, or to derive it from demonstration data. In this paper explore how a rich environment can help to promote the learning of complex behavior. Specifically, we train agents in diverse environmental contexts, and find that this encourages the emergence of robust behaviours that perform well across a suite of tasks. We demonstrate this principle for locomotion - behaviours that are known for their sensitivity to the choice of reward. We train several simulated bodies on a diverse set of challenging terrains and obstacles, using a simple reward function based on forward progress. Using a novel scalable variant of policy gradient reinforcement learning, our agents learn to run, jump, crouch and turn as required by the environment without explicit reward-based guidance. A visual depiction of highlights of the learned behavior can be viewed in this video .","

However, the practical realization of reinforcement learning in difficult environments remains a significant challenge. Firstly, the exploration-exploitation trade-off must be effectively managed in order to balance the exploration of new actions with the exploitation of known ones. Secondly, the scalability of reinforcement learning algorithms must be improved to handle large and complex state spaces. Finally, the stability and robustness of learned policies must be ensured in the presence of uncertainty and changing environmental conditions.

"Current object detection frameworks mainly rely on bounding box regression to localize objects. Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, the precision of bounding box regression remains unsatisfactory, hence limiting performance in object detection. We observe that precise localization requires careful placement of each side of the bounding box. However, the mainstream approach, which focuses on predicting centers and sizes, is not the most effective way to accomplish this task, especially when there exists displacements with large variance between the anchors and the targets. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, named as Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL), where each side of the bounding box is respectively localized with a dedicated network branch. Moreover, to tackle the difficulty of precise localization in the presence of displacements with large variance, we further propose a two-step localization scheme, which first predicts a range of movement through bucket prediction and then pinpoints the precise position within the predicted bucket. We test the proposed method on both two-stage and single-stage detection frameworks. Replacing the standard bounding box regression branch with the proposed design leads to significant improvements on Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN, by 3.0, 1.6, and 0.9, respectively.

By conducting a series of experiments, we quantify the efficiency gains in neuron utilization as a function of depth in network architecture. Our results suggest that deep architectures exhibit a higher hierarchical organization of feature representation, which enables them to encode more abstract representations with fewer neurons at each subsequent layer. Furthermore, we examine the trade-offs between depth and width in neural networks, and provide insights into the optimal balance for various classes of problems. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the depth versus width dilemma in neural network design and provide empirical evidence supporting the notion that deep networks are not only preferred for their representational power but also for their neuron efficiency.",no

" A popular model for such problems is to embed sentences into fixed size vectors, and use composition functions (e.g. concatenation or sum) of those vectors as features for the prediction. At the same time, composition of embeddings has been a main focus within the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) whose goal is to predict relations between entities (typically from knowledge base triples). In this article, we show that previous work on relation prediction between texts implicitly uses compositions from baseline SRL models. We show that such compositions are not expressive enough for several tasks (e.g. natural language inference). We build on recent SRL models to address textual relational problems, showing that they are more expressive, and can alleviate issues from simpler compositions. The resulting models significantly improve the state of the art in both transferable sentence representation learning and relation prediction.","In this study, we extend the exploration of the modeling of semantic relations by proposing a novel neural approach to effectively embed sentences, aiming to capture the nuanced interplay between textual elements. Our methodology leverages recent advances in deep learning to facilitate the embedding of sentences in a high-dimensional space where semantic relationships such as similarity, entailment, and discourse relations can be more accurately represented and identified. By experimenting with a diverse set of benchmarks and linguistic tasks, we demonstrate the robustness of our sentence embeddings against conventional models. We also introduce a specialized loss function that directly targets the preservation of semantic relational properties, thereby enhancing the model's ability to generalize across various NLP challenges. Our results reveal that the proposed embeddings yield significant improvements in performance metrics, confirming the potential of our approach for comprehensive semantic analysis in a wide array of text-based applications.",no
" Indeed, the vast literature on computational epidemiology offers solid grounds for analytical studies and the definition of novel models aimed at both predictive and prescriptive scenario descriptions. To ease the access to diffusion modeling, several programming libraries and tools have been proposed during the last decade: however, to the best of our knowledge, none of them is explicitly designed to allow its users to integrate public interventions in their model. In this work, we introduce UTLDR, a framework that can simulate the effects of several public interventions (and their combinations) on the unfolding of epidemic processes. UTLDR enables the design of compartmental models incrementally and to simulate them over complex interaction network topologies. Moreover, it allows integrating external information on the analyzed population (e.g., age, gender, geographical allocation, and mobility patterns...) and to use it to stratify and refine the designed model. After introducing the framework, we provide a few case studies to underline its flexibility and expressive power.","In this context, diffusion modeling has become a pivotal approach to understanding and predicting the spread of the virus, which is often incorporated into programming platforms for simulating different scenarios of contagion dynamics. This article presents a novel computational framework that integrates advanced diffusion modeling techniques within a robust programming environment to analyze the spatial-temporal transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2. We introduce a set of innovative algorithms that capture the complex interactions between hosts, taking into account various factors such as social behavior, mobility patterns, and intervention strategies. Our programming toolset allows researchers to calibrate models easily, run extensive simulations, and visualize the results in a user-friendly manner. The proposed framework aims to assist public health decision-makers in crafting informed policies by providing accurate predictions of epidemic spread under a variety of hypothetical conditions. Preliminary results demonstrate the model's efficacy in capturing the early stages of the outbreak and its ability to adapt to new data, hinting at the potential for real-time epidemic forecasting.",no

" The proposed architecture consists of multiple Echo State Networks to predict blood glucose levels combined with Model Predictive Controller for planning. Echo State Network is a version of recurrent neural networks which allows us to learn long term dependencies in the input of time series data in an online manner.

" However, in many domains, we are interested in performing well on metrics specific to the application. In this paper we propose a direct loss minimization approach to train deep neural networks, which provably minimizes the application-specific loss function. This is often non-trivial, since these functions are neither smooth nor decomposable and thus are not amenable to optimization with standard gradient-based methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the context of maximizing average precision for ranking problems. Towards this goal, we develop a novel dynamic programming algorithm that can efficiently compute the weight updates. Our approach proves superior to a variety of baselines in the context of action classification and object detection, especially in the presence of label noise.","In this study, we extend the application of deep neural nets to the domain of action classification in video data, which requires the model to identify and classify actions based on the integration of spatial and temporal information. The object of our investigation is to examine the effects of different supervised training strategies on the accuracy of action classification tasks. We hypothesize that optimized cross-entropy minimization, when augmented with additional regularization techniques and tailored to the spatio-temporal nature of video, can lead to substantial improvements in model performance. Our methodology involves implementing various convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures designed specifically for action recognition, and then training these models using a dataset curated for assessing the effectiveness of our approach. We systematically evaluate the role of cross-entropy as a loss function in combination with other factors, such as dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of these elements can significantly enhance the discriminative power of deep neural nets for action classification.",no

"A commonly used technique for managing AI complexity in real-time strategy (RTS) games is to use action andor state abstractions. High-level abstractions can often lead to good strategic decision making, but tactical decision quality may suffer due to lost details. A competing method is to sample the search space which often leads to good tactical performance in simple scenarios, but poor high-level planning. We propose to use a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to select among a limited set of abstract action choices, and to utilize the remaining computation time for game tree search to improve low level tactics. The CNN is trained by supervised learning on game states labelled by Puppet Search , a strategic search algorithm that uses action abstractions. The network is then used to select a script - an abstract action - to produce low level actions for all units. Subsequently, the game tree search algorithm improves the tactical actions of a subset of units using a limited view of the game state only considering units close to opponent units. Experiments in the RTS game show that the combined algorithm results in higher win-rates than either of its two independent components and other state-of-the-art RTS agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of a convolutional network to play a full RTS game on standard game maps, as previous work has focused on sub-problems, such as combat, or on very small maps.","A commonly used technique for managing AI complexity in real-time strategy (RTS) games is to use action andor state abstractions.

"Fourier phase retrieval is a classical problem that deals with the recovery of an image from the amplitude measurements of its Fourier coefficients.

Lumen represents an advanced global illumination system capable of simulating diffuse interreflections with countless bounces and indirect specular reflections across a wide array of scales. With Unreal Engine 5, artists can manipulate lighting in the Unreal Editor and expect it to replicate accurately in-game on a console. A preview of Unreal Engine 5 is anticipated for early 2021, with the official launch scheduled for later that year. Games produced with Unreal Engine will benefit from royalty exemption for the first $1 million of in-game earnings, with this generous new licensing condition applying retroactively from January 1, 2020.",yes
" However, some categories in the image datasets are more difficult to distinguished than others. Improving the classification accuracy on these confused categories is benefit to the overall performance. In this paper, we build a Confusion Visual Tree (CVT) based on the confused semantic level information to identify the confused categories. With the information provided by the CVT, we can lead the CNN training procedure to pay more attention on these confused categories. Therefore, we propose Visual Tree Convolutional Neural Networks (VT-CNN) based on the original deep CNN embedded with our CVT. We evaluate our VT-CNN model on the benchmark datasets CIFAR- 10 and CIFAR- 100 . In our experiments, we build up 3 different VT-CNN models and they obtain improvement over their based CNN models by 1.36 , 0.89 and 0.64 , respectively.","In this paper, we propose a novel architecture that integrates a Confusion Visual Tree (CVT) with CNN models to further enhance their ability in image classification tasks. The CVT is designed to tackle the issue of inter-class similarity that often leads to misclassification in conventional CNNs. By utilizing hierarchical visual cues and confusion metrics derived from the training data, our CVT method provides a structured approach to distinguish between easily confusable classes. We incorporate this tree structure into the CNN model, allowing for more refined feature extraction and decision boundaries tailored to complex datasets. Experimental results show that our integrated CVT-CNN model outperforms traditional CNNs, particularly in scenarios with high class overlap. The confusion visual tree not only improves classification accuracy but also offers interpretability by highlighting discriminative features responsible for differentiating similar classes. Our approach provides a significant step forward in the field of image recognition, suggesting that the addition of confusion-aware mechanisms can greatly benefit deep learning models in handling intricate classification tasks.",no

"The problem of joint source-channel coding is considered for a stationary remote (noisy) Gaussian source and a Gaussian channel. The encoder and decoder are assumed to be causal and their combined operations are subject to a delay constraint. It is shown that, under the mean-square error distortion metric, an optimal encoder-decoder pair from the linear and time-invariant (LTI) class can be found by minimization of a convex functional and a spectral factorization. The functional to be minimized is the sum of the well-known cost in a corresponding Wiener filter problem and a new term, which is induced by the channel noise and whose coefficient is the inverse of the channel's signal-to-noise ratio. This result is shown to also hold in the case of vector-valued signals, assuming parallel additive white Gaussian noise channels. It is also shown that optimal LTI encoders and decoders generally require infinite memory, which implies that approximations are necessary.

"Keypoint-based methods are a relatively new paradigm in object detection, eliminating the need for anchor boxes and offering a simplified detection framework. Keypoint-based CornerNet achieves state of the art accuracy among single-stage detectors. However, this accuracy comes at high processing cost.

"Microfluidic devices are utilized to control and direct flow behavior in a wide variety of applications, particularly in medical diagnostics. A particularly popular form of microfluidics - called inertial microfluidic flow sculpting - involves placing a sequence of pillars to controllably deform an initial flow field into a desired one. Inertial flow sculpting can be formally defined as an inverse problem, where one identifies a sequence of pillars (chosen, with replacement, from a finite set of pillars, each of which produce a specific transformation) whose composite transformation results in a user-defined desired transformation. Endemic to most such problems in engineering, inverse problems are usually quite computationally intractable, with most traditional approaches based on search and optimization strategies. In this paper, we pose this inverse problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. We train a DoubleDQN agent to learn from this environment. The results suggest that learning is possible using a DoubleDQN model with the success frequency reaching 90 in 200,000 episodes and the rewards converging. While most of the results are obtained by fixing a particular target flow shape to simplify the learning problem, we later demonstrate how to transfer the learning of an agent based on one target shape to another, i.e. from one design to another and thus be useful for a generic design of a flow shape.","Microfluidic devices control flow behavior in various applications, including medical diagnostics.

"A multi-armed bandit with finitely many arms is studied when each arm is a homogeneous Markov process on an underlying finite state space. The transition law of one of the arms, referred to as the odd arm, is different from the common transition law of all other arms. A learner, who has no knowledge of the above transition laws, has to devise a sequential test to identify the index of the odd arm as quickly as possible, subject to an upper bound on the probability of error. For this problem, we derive an asymptotic lower bound on the expected stopping time of any sequential test of the learner, where the asymptotics is as the probability of error vanishes. Furthermore, we propose a sequential test, and show that the asymptotic behaviour of its expected stopping time comes arbitrarily close to that of the lower bound. Prior works deal with independent and identically distributed arms, whereas our work deals with Markov arms. Our analysis of the rested Markov setting is a key first step in understanding the difficult case of restless Markov setting, which is still open.","In this study, we extend the classical multi-armed bandit problem by considering the scenario where each arm is governed by a homogeneous Markov process with a finite state space. The decision-making process is based on observations from a sequence of pulls on the arms, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards over time. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel algorithm that combines elements of reinforcement learning with Markov decision processes. Our methodology integrates exploration-exploitation trade-offs inherent in the multi-armed bandit framework with the state transition dynamics of the Markov processes. We introduce a state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) learning scheme adapted to the multi-armed bandit context, which utilizes the transition probabilities to better estimate the expected rewards. The theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm includes a finite-sample regret bound that highlights the benefits of considering the Markovian structure of the arms. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional bandit strategies, such as ε-greedy and upper confidence",no
"When tracking user-specific online activities, each user's preference is revealed in the form of choices and comparisons. For example, a user's purchase history tracks her choices, i.e. which item was chosen among a subset of offerings. A user's comparisons are observed either explicitly as in movie ratings or implicitly as in viewing times of news articles. Given such individualized ordinal data, we address the problem of collaboratively learning representations of the users and the items. The learned features can be used to predict a user's preference of an unseen item to be used in recommendation systems. This also allows one to compute similarities among users and items to be used for categorization and search. Motivated by the empirical successes of the MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model in marketing and transportation, and also more recent successes in word embedding and crowdsourced image embedding, we pose this problem as learning the MNL model parameters that best explains the data. We propose a convex optimization for learning the MNL model, and show that it is minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor by comparing its performance to a fundamental lower bound. This characterizes the minimax sample complexity of the problem, and proves that the proposed estimator cannot be improved upon other than by a logarithmic factor. Further, the analysis identifies how the accuracy depends on the topology of sampling via the spectrum of the sampling graph. This provides a guideline for designing surveys when one can choose which items are to be compared. This is accompanies by numerical simulations on synthetic and real datasets confirming our theoretical predictions.","A user's preferences are revealed through their choices and comparisons, such as purchase history and movie ratings.

" However, in many domains, we are interested in performing well on metrics specific to the application. In this paper we propose a direct loss minimization approach to train deep neural networks, which provably minimizes the application-specific loss function. This is often non-trivial, since these functions are neither smooth nor decomposable and thus are not amenable to optimization with standard gradient-based methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the context of maximizing average precision for ranking problems. Towards this goal, we develop a novel dynamic programming algorithm that can efficiently compute the weight updates. Our approach proves superior to a variety of baselines in the context of action classification and object detection, especially in the presence of label noise.","
However, minimizing cross-entropy does not guarantee the model's ability to generalize well to new examples, especially in cases where the training data is limited or biased.

In this study, we explore the use of contrastive loss for action classification objects, and examine its effectiveness in improving the model's performance on unseen data.

" We argue that in spite of a lack of federal investment, large amounts of publicly available data offer scientists an opportunity to measure a range of firearm-related behaviors. Given the diversity of available data - including news coverage, social media, web forums, online advertisements, and Internet searches (to name a few) - there are ample opportunities for scientists to study everything from trends in particular types of gun violence to gun-related behaviors (such as purchases and safety practices) to public understanding of and sentiment towards various gun violence reduction measures. Science has been sidelined in the gun violence debate for too long. Scientists must tap the big media datastream and help resolve this crisis.","In this study, we aim to explore the landscape of firearm-related behaviors and their implications on public health outcomes in the context of the United States. Despite historical challenges posed by a strategy of obstructionism, our research seeks to overcome these barriers by employing innovative methodologies to collect and analyze data on gun violence and ownership patterns. Through a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analyses of existing databases with qualitative interviews, we endeavor to elucidate the factors influencing firearm-related behaviors, including cultural attitudes, legal frameworks, and socioeconomic variables. The ultimate goal is to provide an evidence-based foundation for policymakers and stakeholders to craft effective interventions aimed at reducing the incidence and impact of gun-related incidents on American society.",no
" In practice, however, it is common to carefully hand-design the reward function to encourage a particular solution, or to derive it from demonstration data. In this paper explore how a rich environment can help to promote the learning of complex behavior. Specifically, we train agents in diverse environmental contexts, and find that this encourages the emergence of robust behaviours that perform well across a suite of tasks. We demonstrate this principle for locomotion - behaviours that are known for their sensitivity to the choice of reward. We train several simulated bodies on a diverse set of challenging terrains and obstacles, using a simple reward function based on forward progress. Using a novel scalable variant of policy gradient reinforcement learning, our agents learn to run, jump, crouch and turn as required by the environment without explicit reward-based guidance. A visual depiction of highlights of the learned behavior can be viewed in this video .","In this study, we investigate the efficiency and scalability of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms when tasked with acquiring complex behaviors from minimalistic reward structures.

" We consider a slotted-mode of operation where each slot of SU is used for either energy harvesting or data transmission. Considering block fading with memory, we model the energy arrival and fading processes as a stationary Markov process of first order. We propose a harvest-or-transmit policy for the SU along with optimal transmit powers that maximize its expected throughput under three different settings. First, we consider a learning-theoretic approach where we do not assume any apriori knowledge about the underlying Markov processes. In this case, we obtain an online policy using Q-learning . Then, we assume that the full statistical knowledge of the governing Markov process is known apriori. Under this assumption, we obtain an optimal online policy using infinite horizon stochastic dynamic programming . Finally, we obtain an optimal offline policy using the generalized Benders decomposition algorithm. The offline policy assumes that for a given time deadline, the energy arrivals and channel states are known in advance at all the transmitters. Finally, we compare all policies and study the effects of various system parameters on the system performance.","In this study, we investigate the implications of energy harvesting on the performance of the underlay cognitive radio network.

"Recently there has been much interest in understanding why deep neural networks are preferred to shallow networks. We show that, for a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network to approximate a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function approximation. First, we consider univariate functions on a bounded interval and require a neural network to achieve an approximation error of uniformly over the interval. We show that shallow networks (i.e., networks whose depth does not depend on ) require ( poly ( 1 neurons while deep networks (i.e., networks whose depth grows with 1 ) require O ( polylog ( 1 neurons. We then extend these results to certain classes of important multivariate functions. Our results are derived for neural networks which use a combination of rectifier linear units (ReLUs) and binary step units, two of the most popular type of activation functions. Our analysis builds on a simple observation: the multiplication of two bits can be represented by a ReLU.","Deep neural networks are favored over shallow networks for piecewise smooth functions, as shallow networks require exponentially more neurons to approximate a function.

"MIMO interference network optimization is important for increasingly crowded wireless communication networks. We provide a new algorithm, named Dual Link algorithm, for the classic problem of weighted sum-rate maximization for MIMO multiaccess channels (MAC), broadcast channels (BC), and general MIMO interference channels with Gaussian input and a total power constraint. For MIMO MACBC, the algorithm finds optimal signals to achieve the capacity region boundary. For interference channels with Gaussian input assumption, two of the previous state-of-the-art algorithms are the WMMSE algorithm and the polite water-filling (PWF) algorithm. The WMMSE algorithm is provably convergent, while the PWF algorithm takes the advantage of the optimal transmit signal structure and converges the fastest in most situations but is not guaranteed to converge in all situations. It is highly desirable to design an algorithm that has the advantages of both algorithms. The dual link algorithm is such an algorithm. Its fast and guaranteed convergence is important to distributed implementation and time varying channels. In addition, the technique and a scaling invariance property used in the convergence proof may find applications in other non-convex problems in communication networks.","

Abstract - This paper addresses the issue of MIMO interference network optimization in crowded wireless communication networks. The proposed approach utilizes a novel algorithm that takes into account the spatial distribution of interfering nodes and optimizes the placement and orientation of antennas to minimize interference. Simulation results show a significant improvement in network performance compared to traditional methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed technique in mitigating interference and increasing network capacity. Furthermore, the algorithm is found to be robust against changes in network topology and user behavior, making it a promising solution for real-world wireless communication networks.

" The recently proposed extended variational inference (EVI) framework is adopted to derive an analytically tractable solution.

Therefore, the problem of pre-determining the optimal number of mixing components has been overcome.

" Existing techniques for detecting spam include predicting the trustworthiness of accounts and analyzing the content of these messages. However, advanced attackers can still successfully evade these defenses. Online social networks bring people who have personal connections or share common interests to form communities. In this paper, we first show that users within a networked community share some topics of interest. Moreover, content shared on these social network tend to propagate according to the interests of people. Dissemination paths may emerge where some communities post similar messages, based on the interests of those communities. Spam and other malicious content, on the other hand, follow different spreading patterns. In this paper, we follow this insight and present POISED , a system that leverages the differences in propagation between benign and malicious messages on social networks to identify spam and other unwanted content. We test our system on a dataset of 1.3M tweets collected from 64K users, and we show that our approach is effective in detecting malicious messages, reaching 91 precision and 93 recall. We also show that POISED 's detection is more comprehensive than previous systems, by comparing it to three state-of-the-art spam detection systems that have been proposed by the research community in the past. POISED significantly outperforms each of these systems. Moreover, through simulations, we show how POISED is effective in the early detection of spam messages and how it is resilient against two well-known adversarial machine learning attacks.","The proliferation of online social networks has created new opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit and disseminate spam and malicious content within these communities.

"A multi-armed bandit with finitely many arms is studied when each arm is a homogeneous Markov process on an underlying finite state space. The transition law of one of the arms, referred to as the odd arm, is different from the common transition law of all other arms. A learner, who has no knowledge of the above transition laws, has to devise a sequential test to identify the index of the odd arm as quickly as possible, subject to an upper bound on the probability of error. For this problem, we derive an asymptotic lower bound on the expected stopping time of any sequential test of the learner, where the asymptotics is as the probability of error vanishes. Furthermore, we propose a sequential test, and show that the asymptotic behaviour of its expected stopping time comes arbitrarily close to that of the lower bound. Prior works deal with independent and identically distributed arms, whereas our work deals with Markov arms. Our analysis of the rested Markov setting is a key first step in understanding the difficult case of restless Markov setting, which is still open.","

The multi-armed bandit problem with homogeneous Markov processes on finite state spaces has been widely studied in recent years. However, there has been limited research on the scenario where the number of arms is also finite and the underlying state space is infinite. This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel algorithm that can effectively handle such a situation. Our proposed algorithm combines the epsilon-greedy strategy with a modified UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) algorithm. The epsilon-greedy strategy selects the arm with the highest estimated mean reward with probability (1 - ε) and chooses a random arm with probability ε. The modified UCB algorithm uses a different exploration rate for each arm, which is inversely proportional to the number of times the arm has been pulled. Simulations show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of cumulative regret when the number of arms is finite and",no

"Current object detection frameworks mainly rely on bounding box regression to localize objects. Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, the precision of bounding box regression remains unsatisfactory, hence limiting performance in object detection. We observe that precise localization requires careful placement of each side of the bounding box. However, the mainstream approach, which focuses on predicting centers and sizes, is not the most effective way to accomplish this task, especially when there exists displacements with large variance between the anchors and the targets. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, named as Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL), where each side of the bounding box is respectively localized with a dedicated network branch. Moreover, to tackle the difficulty of precise localization in the presence of displacements with large variance, we further propose a two-step localization scheme, which first predicts a range of movement through bucket prediction and then pinpoints the precise position within the predicted bucket. We test the proposed method on both two-stage and single-stage detection frameworks. Replacing the standard bounding box regression branch with the proposed design leads to significant improvements on Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN, by 3.0, 1.6, and 0.9, respectively. Code and models will be available at .","Contemporary frameworks for object detection predominantly use bounding box regression to pinpoint object locations. Yet, despite advances in recent times, the accuracy of bounding box regression is not thoroughly satisfying, which restricts the capabilities of object detection systems. It's noted that exact placement of a bounding box's edges is essential for accurate localization. Contrarily, the prevalent method focusing on predicting object centers and sizes doesn't effectively achieve this task, particularly in scenarios where there is a significant disparity between the anchor points and the actual targets. In our study, we introduce a new methodology called Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL), wherein a specialized network branch is dedicated to localizing each side of the bounding box. Furthermore, to overcome the challenge of achieving precise localization amidst large variations in displacement, we also present a two-phased localization technique. This technique initially forecasts a potential movement range using bucket prediction and subsequently, narrows down to the exact location within the foreseen range. We have validated our methodology on both dual-stage and single-stage detection frameworks. By integrating our proposed structure in place of the conventional bounding box regression branches, there have been notable upgrades in the performance of Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN, with improvements of 3.0, 1.6, and 0.9 points, respectively.

"Unordered data Petri nets (UDPN) are an extension of classical Petri nets with tokens that carry data from an infinite domain and where transitions may check equality and disequality of tokens. UDPN are well-structured, so the coverability and termination problems are decidable, but with higher complexity than for Petri nets. On the other hand, the problem of reachability for UDPN is surprisingly complex, and its decidability status remains open. In this paper, we consider the continuous reachability problem for UDPN, which can be seen as an over-approximation of the reachability problem. Our main result is a characterization of continuous reachability for UDPN and polynomial time algorithm for solving it. This is a consequence of a combinatorial argument, which shows that if continuous reachability holds then there exists a run using only polynomially many data values.","

" Such problems have applications, e.g., in computational biology. We provide a number of new and improved bounds for exact string reconstruction for settings where either the string or the queries are ""mixed-up."" For example, we show that a periodic (i.e., ""mixed-up string, S p k p , of smallest period p , where p p , can be reconstructed using O ( p lg n) substring queries, where is the alphabet size, if n S is unknown. We also show that we can reconstruct S after having been corrupted by a small number of errors d , measured by Hamming distance. In this case, we give an algorithm that uses O ( d p d p lg n d 1) queries. In addition, we show that a periodic string can be reconstructed using 2 lg n 2 p lg subsequence queries, and that general strings can be reconstructed using 2 lg n n lg subsequence queries, without knowledge of n in advance.

In this paper, we design decentralized protocols for anonymous broadcast that require each party to send (and compute) a polylogarithmic number of bits (and operations) per anonymous bit delivered with O (log n) rounds of communication. Our protocol is provably secure against traffic analysis, does not require any trusted party, and is completely load-balanced. The protocol tolerates up to n 6 statically-scheduled Byzantine parties that are controlled by a computationally unbounded adversary. Our main strategy for achieving scalability is to perform local communications (and computations) among a logarithmic number of parties. We provide simulation results to show that our protocol improves significantly over previous work. We finally show that using a common cryptographic tool in our protocol one can achieve practical results for anonymous broadcast.","In anonymous broadcasting, one or more parties wish to send messages anonymously to all parties.

"Tracking the state of the conversation is a central component in task-oriented spoken dialogue systems. One such approach for tracking the dialogue state is slot carryover , where a model makes a binary decision if a slot from the context is relevant to the current turn.

A close analysis of the results show that this approach results in poor performance over longer context dialogues. In this paper, we propose to jointly model the slots.

" Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, the precision of bounding box regression remains unsatisfactory, hence limiting performance in object detection. We observe that precise localization requires careful placement of each side of the bounding box. However, the mainstream approach, which focuses on predicting centers and sizes, is not the most effective way to accomplish this task, especially when there exists displacements with large variance between the anchors and the targets. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, named as Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL), where each side of the bounding box is respectively localized with a dedicated network branch. Moreover, to tackle the difficulty of precise localization in the presence of displacements with large variance, we further propose a two-step localization scheme, which first predicts a range of movement through bucket prediction and then pinpoints the precise position within the predicted bucket. We test the proposed method on both two-stage and single-stage detection frameworks. Replacing the standard bounding box regression branch with the proposed design leads to significant improvements on Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN, by 3.0, 1.6, and 0.9, respectively.

" In this paper, we model such a two-layer heterogenous network based on stochastic geometry approach.

The second is named as dependent power control where the transmit power of each user is dependent on its own channel condition. A closed-form expression of optimal independent power control is derived, and we point out that the optimal power control for this case is fixed and not relevant to the randomness of the network. For the dependent power control case, we propose an efficient way to find the close-to-optimal solution for the power-efficiency optimization problem. Numerical results show that dependent power control scheme saves about half of power that the independent power control scheme demands.","In this study, we investigate the potential of D2D communication to perform as independent networks channels within the broader cellular ecosystem.

" In this paper, we conduct a qualitative study to explore why email spoofing is still possible after years of efforts to design, develop, and promote anti-spoofing protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). Previous research shows that the adoption rates of anti-spoofing protocols are still very low. To understand the reasons behind the slow adoption, we conduct a user study with 9 email administrators from different institutions. The results show that email administrators are aware of the weaknesses of these protocols and believe the current protocol adoption lacks the crucial mass due to the protocol defects, weak incentives, and practical deployment challenges. Based on these results, we discuss the key implications to protocol designers, email providers and users, and future research directions to mitigate the email spoofing threats.","

To effectively mitigate email spoofing attacks, organizations and individuals must implement anti-spoofing protocols that can detect and prevent such impersonations. Several approaches have been proposed and tested, including machine learning algorithms that analyze the email content and metadata to identify suspicious patterns, as well as authentication protocols that verify the sender's identity before the email is delivered to the recipient's inbox. One widely used anti-spoofing protocol is the Sender Policy Framework (SPF), which defines a set of rules that governs how email senders can use their domain names. By implementing SPF, organizations can prevent attackers from using their domain names to impersonate legitimate senders. Another protocol is the Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC), which provides a mechanism for senders to authenticate their emails and report any suspicious activity to the domain owner.",no

"Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful approach for seeking the global optimum of expensive black-box functions and has proven successful for fine tuning hyper-parameters of machine learning models. The Bayesian optimization routine involves learning a response surface and maximizing a score to select the most valuable inputs to be queried at the next iteration. These key steps are subject to the curse of dimensionality so that Bayesian optimization does not scale beyond 10-20 parameters. In this work, we address this issue and propose a high-dimensional BO method that learns a nonlinear low-dimensional manifold of the input space. We achieve this with a multi-layer neural network embedded in the covariance function of a Gaussian process. This approach applies unsupervised dimensionality reduction as a byproduct of a supervised regression solution. This also allows exploiting data efficiency of Gaussian process models in a Bayesian framework. We also introduce a nonlinear mapping from the manifold to the high-dimensional space based on multi-output Gaussian processes and jointly train it end-to-end via marginal likelihood maximization. We show this intrinsically low-dimensional optimization outperforms recent baselines in high-dimensional BO literature on a set of benchmark functions in 60 dimensions.","Bayesian optimization (BO) is an effective strategy for identifying the global maximum of costly black-box functions and has been notably successful in optimizing the hyper-parameters for machine learning algorithms. This process entails creating a predictive model of the function and optimizing a criterion to determine which data points to explore next. However, the complexity increases exponentially with the number of dimensions, making it impractical for BO to handle more than 10-20 variables. To overcome this limitation, our research presents a novel approach for high-dimensional BO that discovers a non-linear, lower-dimensional representation of the input space through a multi-layer neural network integrated within the Gaussian process's covariance function. This technique incorporates unsupervised learning for dimension reduction as part of the supervised regression, and leverages the data efficiency inherent in Gaussian process models within a Bayesian setting. Additionally, we developed a non-linear projection from the reduced manifold back to the original high-dimensional space using multi-output Gaussian processes, and we train this system in its entirety through marginal likelihood maximization. Our approach, which inherently operates on low-dimensional assumptions, demonstrates superior performance over recent standards in the field of high-dimensional BO, as evidenced by benchmark testing on functions with up to 60 dimensions.",yes

"Cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has become the gold standard for the non-invasive evaluation of cardiac function. In particular, it allows the accurate quantification of functional parameters including the chamber volumes and ejection fraction. Deep learning has shown the potential to automate the requisite cardiac structure segmentation. However, the lack of robustness of deep learning models has hindered their widespread clinical adoption. Due to differences in the data characteristics, neural networks trained on data from a specific scanner are not guaranteed to generalise well to data acquired at a different centre or with a different scanner. In this work, we propose a principled solution to the problem of this domain shift. Domain-adversarial learning is used to train a domain-invariant 2D U-Net using labelled and unlabelled data. This approach is evaluated on both seen and unseen domains from the MMs challenge dataset and the domain-adversarial approach shows improved performance as compared to standard training.

"LIDAR (light detection and ranging) is an optical remote-sensing technique that measures the distance between sensor and object, and the reflected energy from the object. Over the years, LIDAR data has been used as the primary source of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). DEMs have been used in a variety of applications like road extraction, hydrological modeling, flood mapping, and surface analysis. A number of studies in flooding suggest the usage of high- resolution DEMs as inputs in the applications improve the overall reliability and accuracy. Despite the importance of high-resolution DEM, many areas in the United States and the world do not have access to high-resolution DEM due to technological limitations or the cost of the data collection. With recent development in Graphical Processing Units (GPU) and novel algorithms, deep learning techniques have become attractive to researchers for their performance in learning features from high-resolution datasets. Numerous new methods have been proposed such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create intelligent models that correct and augment large-scale datasets. In this paper, a GAN based model is developed and evaluated, inspired by single image super-resolution methods, to increase the spatial resolution of a given DEM dataset up to 4 times without additional information related to data.","LIDAR (light detection and ranging) is a technology that uses light to measure the distance and reflectivity between a sensor and an object. Historically, LIDAR-generated data has become the go-to for creating Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), which are essential in applications such as extracting roads, hydrological studies, flood mapping, and analyzing surfaces. Studies related to flooding highlight that using high-resolution DEMs can significantly enhance the precision and dependability of these applications. Yet, obtaining high-resolution DEMs remains a challenge across many regions within the US and globally, often due to the high cost and technological barriers associated with data collection.

" Consistency is defined with respect to strong simulation conformance. We propose learning algorithms that use traditional and a new stochastic state-space partitioning, the latter resulting in the minimum number of states. We then use them to solve the problem of active learning, that uses a knowledgeable teacher to generate samples as counterexamples to simulation equivalence queries. We show that the problem is undecidable in general, but that it becomes decidable under a suitable condition on the teacher which comes naturally from the way samples are generated from failed simulation checks. The latter problem is shown to be undecidable if we impose an additional condition on the learner to always conjecture a minimum state hypothesis. We therefore propose a semi-algorithm using stochastic partitions. Finally, we apply the proposed (semi algorithms to infer intermediate assumptions in an automated assume-guarantee verification framework for probabilistic systems.","In this study, we propose a novel approach to learning non-deterministic probabilistic systems using a modified decision tree algorithm.

" Indeed, the vast literature on computational epidemiology offers solid grounds for analytical studies and the definition of novel models aimed at both predictive and prescriptive scenario descriptions. To ease the access to diffusion modeling, several programming libraries and tools have been proposed during the last decade: however, to the best of our knowledge, none of them is explicitly designed to allow its users to integrate public interventions in their model. In this work, we introduce UTLDR, a framework that can simulate the effects of several public interventions (and their combinations) on the unfolding of epidemic processes. UTLDR enables the design of compartmental models incrementally and to simulate them over complex interaction network topologies. Moreover, it allows integrating external information on the analyzed population (e.g., age, gender, geographical allocation, and mobility patterns...) and to use it to stratify and refine the designed model. After introducing the framework, we provide a few case studies to underline its flexibility and expressive power.","In response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, researchers from diverse fields are increasingly turning to epidemic modeling to understand and predict the spread of the virus.

" We introduce a novel quantity called forward regret that intuitively measures how good an online learning algorithm is if it is allowed a one-step look-ahead into the future. We show that given stability, bounded forward regret is equivalent to bounded regret. We also show that the existence of an algorithm with bounded regret implies the existence of a stable algorithm with bounded regret and bounded forward regret. The equivalence results apply to general, possibly non-convex problems. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the first general connection between stability and regret in the online setting that is not restricted to a particular class of algorithms. Our stability-regret connection provides a simple recipe for analyzing regret incurred by any online learning algorithm. Using our framework, we analyze several existing online learning algorithms as well as the ""approximate"" versions of algorithms like RDA that solve an optimization problem at each iteration. Our proofs are simpler than existing analysis for the respective algorithms, show a clear trade-off between stability and forward regret, and provide tighter regret bounds in some cases. Furthermore, using our recipe, we analyze ""approximate"" versions of several algorithms such as follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) that requires solving an optimization problem at each step.","In this study, we delve deeper into the nature of bounded regret as a pivotal determinant of the learnability in online learning algorithms. Specifically, we examine how the stability of such algorithms—characterized by their ability to maintain performance with incremental data updates—impacts the boundedness of regret over time. Through a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we establish a clear framework that links the stability of online learning mechanisms with their ability to exhibit bounded regret, thereby affirming their learnability. Our findings reveal that there exists a critical threshold of stability beyond which the regret incurred by these algorithms can indeed be bounded. This boundedness ensures that the cumulative performance loss, when compared to the best possible strategy in hindsight, does not grow unboundedly even as the number of iterations becomes large. To substantiate our theoretical assertions, we present empirical evidence from a series of simulations that demonstrate the predicted relationship between stability and bounded regret.

"Random Fourier features is one of the most popular techniques for scaling up kernel methods, such as kernel ridge regression. However, despite impressive empirical results, the statistical properties of random Fourier features are still not well understood. In this paper we take steps toward filling this gap. Specifically, we approach random Fourier features from a spectral matrix approximation point of view, give tight bounds on the number of Fourier features required to achieve a spectral approximation, and show how spectral matrix approximation bounds imply statistical guarantees for kernel ridge regression. Qualitatively, our results are twofold: on the one hand, we show that random Fourier feature approximation can provably speed up kernel ridge regression under reasonable assumptions. At the same time, we show that the method is suboptimal, and sampling from a modified distribution in Fourier space, given by the leverage function of the kernel, yields provably better performance. We study this optimal sampling distribution for the Gaussian kernel, achieving a nearly complete characterization for the case of low-dimensional bounded datasets. Based on this characterization, we propose an efficient sampling scheme with guarantees superior to random Fourier features in this regime.","Random Fourier features are widely used for scaling up kernel methods, but their statistical properties are not well understood.

" Most existing studies on product search focus on developing effective retrieval models that rank items by their likelihood to be purchased. They, however, ignore the problem that there is a gap between how systems and customers perceive the relevance of items. Without explanations, users may not understand why product search engines retrieve certain items for them, which consequentially leads to imperfect user experience and suboptimal system performance in practice. In this work, we tackle this problem by constructing explainable retrieval models for product search.

Then, we assume that the full statistical knowledge of the governing Markov process is known apriori. Under this assumption, we obtain an optimal online policy using infinite horizon stochastic dynamic programming .

LiLi-OM (Livox LiDAR-inertial odometry and mapping) is real-time capable and achieves superior accuracy over state-of-the-art systems for both LiDAR types on public data sets of mechanical LiDARs and in experiments using the Livox Horizon. Source code and recorded experimental data sets are available on Github 1 footnote 1 1 footnote 1 .","In this study, we evaluate the performance of the tightly-coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry and mapping scheme through a series of real-world experiments. We analyze the accuracy and robustness of the system under various environmental conditions and compare the results with existing LiDAR-inertial systems. Our findings demonstrate that the novel tightly-coupled approach outperforms traditional methods, particularly in challenging scenarios such as dynamic environments and low-visibility conditions. These results have implications for the development of autonomous navigation systems and pave the way for future advancements in LiDAR-inertial fusion technology.",no

" By a theorem of McNaughton and Papert, these are also the first-order definable languages. The dot-depth rose to prominence following the work of Thomas, who proved an exact correspondence with the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic: each level in the dot-depth hierarchy consists of all languages that can be defined with a prescribed number of quantifier blocks. One of the most famous open problems in automata theory is to settle whether the membership problem is decidable for each level: is it possible to decide whether an input regular language belongs to this level? Despite a significant research effort, membership by itself has only been solved for low levels. A recent breakthrough was achieved by replacing membership with a more general problem: separation . Given two input languages, one has to decide whether there exists a third language in the investigated level containing the first language and disjoint from the second. The motivation for looking at separation is threefold: (1) while more difficult, it is more rewarding, as solving it requires a better understanding; (2) being more general, it provides a more convenient framework, and (3) all recent membership algorithms are actually reductions to separation for lower levels. We present a separation algorithm for dot-depth two. A key point is that while dot-depth two is our most prominent application, our theorem is more general. We consider a family of hierarchies, which includes the dot-depth: concatenation hierarchies. They are built through a generic construction process: one first chooses an initial class, the basis, which serves as the lowest level in the hierarchy. Then, further levels are built by applying generic operations. Our main theorem states that for any concatenation hierarchy whose basis consists of finitely many languages, separation is decidable for level one. In the special case of the dot-depth, this can be lifted to level two using previously known results.","This paper delves into the intricate structure of the dot-depth hierarchy as initially formulated by Brzozowski and Cohen, which provides a method for classifying star-free languages based on their syntactic complexity. Through a series of detailed analyses, we examine the properties and limitations of the dot-depth hierarchy, exploring its significance in the realm of formal language theory. We outline the sequential levels of the hierarchy, each characterized by the inclusion of concatenation and boolean operations to a certain extent, thus revealing how the complexity of star-free languages increases with each successive level. Furthermore, by employing advanced combinatorial and algebraic techniques, we demonstrate how the hierarchy relates to the recognizability by finite monoids and the quantifier alternation hierarchy in logic. Our research clarifies the hierarchy's role in delineating the boundaries between regular languages that are star-free and those that are not. We also present new findings that extend the current understanding of the hierarchy, including the identification of languages at specific dot-depth levels,",no

"Tracking the state of the conversation is a central component in task-oriented spoken dialogue systems. One such approach for tracking the dialogue state is slot carryover , where a model makes a binary decision if a slot from the context is relevant to the current turn. Previous work on the slot carryover task used models that made independent decisions for each slot. A close analysis of the results show that this approach results in poor performance over longer context dialogues. In this paper, we propose to jointly model the slots. We propose two neural network architectures, one based on pointer networks that incorporate slot ordering information, and the other based on transformer networks that uses self attention mechanism to model the slot interdependencies. Our experiments on an internal dialogue benchmark dataset and on the public DSTC2 dataset demonstrate that our proposed models are able to resolve longer distance slot references and are able to achieve competitive performance.","Slot carryover is a method used in task-oriented spoken dialogue systems to track the conversation state.

"Visual Question Answering (VQA) concerns providing answers to Natural Language questions about images. Several deep neural network approaches have been proposed to model the task in an end-to-end fashion. Whereas the task is grounded in visual processing, if the question focuses on events described by verbs, the language understanding component becomes crucial. Our hypothesis is that models should be aware of verb semantics, as expressed via semantic role labels, argument types, andor frame elements. Unfortunately, no VQA dataset exists that includes verb semantic information. Our first contribution is a new VQA dataset (imSituVQA) that we built by taking advantage of the imSitu annotations. The imSitu dataset consists of images manually labeled with semantic frame elements, mostly taken from FrameNet. Second, we propose a multitask CNN-LSTM VQA model that learns to classify the answers as well as the semantic frame elements. Our experiments show that semantic frame element classification helps the VQA system avoid inconsistent responses and improves performance.","A new dataset (imSituVQA) and a multitask CNN-LSTM VQA model that incorporates verb semantics, utilizing semantic role labels, argument types, and frame elements, were created to improve the accuracy of Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems.",yes

"Architecture patterns capture architectural design experience and provide abstract solutions to recurring architectural design problems. They consist of a description of component types and restrict component connection and activation. Therefore, they guarantee some desired properties for architectures employing the pattern. Unfortunately, most documented patterns do not provide a formal guarantee of whether their specification indeed leads to the desired guarantee. Failure in doing so, however, might lead to wrong architectures, i.e., architectures wrongly supposed to show certain desired properties. Since architectures, in general, have a high impact on the quality of the resulting system and architectural flaws are only difficult, if not to say impossible, to repair, this may lead to badly reparable quality issues in the resulting system. To address this problem, we propose an approach based on model checking to verify pattern specifications w.r.t. their guarantees. In the following we apply the approach to three well-known patterns for dynamic architectures: the Singleton, the Model-View-Controller, and the Broker pattern. Thereby, we discovered ambiguities and missing constraints for all three specifications. Thus, we conclude that verifying patterns of dynamic architectures using model checking is feasible and useful to discover ambiguities and flaws in pattern specifications.","Architectural design experience is captured by architecture patterns, which offer general solutions to frequently encountered architectural design issues.

" However, this methodology can be expensive if the convex hull contains many facets. For example, the convex hull of n -symbol Huffman trees is known to have exponentially many facets (,). We get around this difficulty by exploiting extended formulations (,), which encode the polytope of combinatorial objects in a higher dimensional ""extended"" space with only polynomially many facets. We develop a general framework for converting extended formulations into efficient online algorithms with good relative loss bounds. We present applications of our framework to online learning of Huffman trees and permutations. The regret bounds of the resulting algorithms are within a factor of O (log (n of the state-of-the-art specialized algorithms for permutations, and depending on the loss regimes, improve on or match the state-of-the-art for Huffman trees.
